0,"about me:  i would love to think that i was some some kind of intellectual: either the dumbest smart guy, or the smartest dumb guy. can't say i can tell the difference. i love to talk about ideas and concepts. i forge odd metaphors instead of reciting cliches. like the simularities between a friend of mine's house and an underwater salt mine. my favorite word is salt by the way (weird choice i know). to me most things in life are better as metaphors. i seek to make myself a little better everyday, in some productively lazy way. got tired of tying my shoes. considered hiring a five year old, but would probably have to tie both of our shoes... decided to only wear leather shoes dress shoes.  about you:  you love to have really serious, really deep conversations about really silly stuff. you have to be willing to snap me out of a light hearted rant with a kiss. you don't have to be funny, but you have to be able to make me laugh. you should be able to bend spoons with your mind, and telepathically make me smile while i am still at work. you should love life, and be cool with just letting the wind blow. extra points for reading all this and guessing my favorite video game (no hints given yet). and lastly you have a good attention span.
currently working as an international agent for a freight forwarding company. import, export, domestic you know the works. online classes and trying to better myself in my free time. perhaps a hours worth of a good book or a video game on a lazy sunday.
making people laugh. ranting about a good salting. finding simplicity in complexity, and complexity in simplicity.
the way i look. i am a six foot half asian, half caucasian mutt. it makes it tough not to notice me, and for me to blend in.
books: absurdistan, the republic, of mice and men (only book that made me want to cry), catcher in the rye, the prince.  movies: gladiator, operation valkyrie, the producers, down periscope.  shows: the borgia, arrested development, game of thrones, monty python  music: aesop rock, hail mary mallon, george thorogood and the delaware destroyers, felt  food: i'm down for anything.
food. water. cell phone. shelter.
duality and humorous things
trying to find someone to hang out with. i am down for anything except a club.
i am new to california and looking for someone to wisper my secrets to.
you want to be swept off your feet! you are tired of the norm. you want to catch a coffee or a bite. or if you want to talk philosophy."
5,"i'm an australian living in san francisco, but don't hold that against me. i spend most of my days trying to build cool stuff for my company. i speak mandarin and have been known to bust out chinese songs at karaoke. i'm pretty cheeky. someone asked me if that meant something about my arse, which i find really funny.  i'm a little oddball. i have a wild imagination; i like to think of the most improbable reasons people are doing things just for fun. i love to laugh and look for reasons to do so. occasionally this gets me in trouble because people think i'm laughing at them. sometimes i am, but more often i'm only laughing at myself.  i'm an entrepreneur (like everyone else in sf, it seems) and i love what i do. i enjoy parties and downtime in equal measure. intelligence really turns me on and i love people who can teach me new things.
building awesome stuff. figuring out what's important. having adventures. looking for treasure.
imagining random shit. laughing at aforementioned random shit. being goofy. articulating what i think and feel. convincing people i'm right. admitting when i'm wrong.  i'm also pretty good at helping people think through problems; my friends say i give good advice. and when i don't have a clue how to help, i will say: i give pretty good hug.
i have a big smile. i also get asked if i'm wearing blue-coloured contacts (no).
books: to kill a mockingbird, lord of the rings, 1984, the farseer trilogy.  music: the beatles, frank sinatra, john mayer, jason mraz, deadmau5, andrew bayer, everything on anjunadeep records, bach, satie.  tv shows: how i met your mother, scrubs, the west wing, breaking bad.  movies: star wars, the godfather pt ii, 500 days of summer, napoleon dynamite, american beauty, lotr  food: thai, vietnamese, shanghai dumplings, pizza!
like everyone else, i love my friends and family, and need hugs, human contact, water and sunshine. let's take that as given.  1. something to build 2. something to sing 3. something to play on (my guitar would be first choice) 4. something to write/draw on 5. a big goal worth dreaming about 6. something to laugh at
what my contribution to the world is going to be and/or should be. and what's for breakfast. i love breakfast.
out with my friends!
i cried on my first day at school because a bird shat on my head. true story.
you're awesome."
9,"my names jake. i'm a creative guy and i look for the same in others.  i'm easy going, practical and i don't have many hang ups. i appreciate life and try to live it to the fullest. i'm sober and have been for the past few years.  i love music and i play guitar. i like tons of different bands. i'm an artist and i love to paint/draw etc. and i love creative people.  i've got to say i'm not too big on internet dating. you cant really get an earnest impression of anyone from a few polished paragraphs. but we'll see, you never know.
i have an apartment. i like to explore and check things out. i like good japanese and peruvian food. nothing beats good ceviche on a hot day. or a hot chai on a cold one.  i've been working on my a.o.d. certification but have stalled out. i'm hoping to pursue art but have yet to find the best venue. recently i've been working on a construction job in belmont. it's not my dream job. but for the time being it affords me other opportunities. plus it keeps me in shape, so i shouldn't complain.
i'm good at finding creative solutions to problems. i can organize a living space pretty well. i'm good at making people smile. i'm good at laughing at inappropriate times. and i make a mean bowl of cereal.
i'm short
i like some tv. i love summer heights high and angry boys. and i love fringe.  i'm reading stiff after finishing elliott smith and the big nothing (loved it). i like biographies.  i love music. it would be impossible to list everything i like because the list grows exponentially. i like george harrison or the clash. i like flight of the conchord's, old radiohead and elliott smith. djali zwan, x, the knitters, the kinks, john lennon, floyd, nina simone, the smiths, seu jorge, the sex pistols, immortal technique, al green, dead kennedy's, the beatles, cat stevens, nine inch nails, the dead, bob dylan etc. my taste is varied, i love music.  and i love movie's, i like all kinds. these days i'm at netflix more often though. and i never miss science friday's.

10,"update: i'm seeing someone, so off the market :)  i have blue eyes, live in the mission, love to laugh and make people smile. i'm a social liberal. honesty impresses me, i'm not a fan of lying unless it involves soft grass or a bed. i've heard that lots of gents on the cupid lie about/exaggerate their height. i am in fact 5'10.5"", for whatever that's worth. i love female energy. i am endlessly fascinated by women, and the best thing about okc is that i get to meet independent and interesting girls that i would never have encountered in my daily life. i'm very comfortable to be around and i have fun helping people overcome problems or gain fresh insights into their personalities.  favorite spirit:single malt scotch go-to drink:jack&coke favorite beers: kostritzer, hoegaarden beers i'm more likely to actually be drinking: pabst, tecate, miller with breakfast: irish coffee personality type: enfj
i have three jobs. i've been doing sound and lighting for events, making new friends, keeping the old ones, reading, drinking strong coffee, exercising, helping friends move(the curse of truck ownership), teaching myself to sing and play guitar simultaneously, making everyone around me smile
hugging, kissing, laughing, motivating people, massage, cooking, reading
my huge goofy smile
i'm constantly reading, i read at what my friends describe as an incredible pace. it's my superpower. favorite authors include tim powers, kurt vonnegut, philip k. dick, neal asher, harry harrison, robin hobb, jim butcher, joe haldeman, greg bear, matthew woodring stover, patrick rothfuss, alan dean foster, larry niven, mike resnick, robert e. howard, s. andrew swann, jerry pournelle, steven gould, john steakley, steve perry, gordon dickson, john dalmas, iain banks, vernor vinge, poul anderson, dan simmons, ken follett, jeffrey archer...  i love me some movies: they live, scott pilgrim vs the world, the usual suspects, willow, anything involving luc besson and/or jean reno, repo men, chok dee, true romance, plunkett and macleane, the 40 year old virgin, tropic thunder, serenity, beerfest, marathon man, the golden child, coming to america, anything directed by wes anderson(darjeeling limited, royal tenenbaums, etc.), the big lebowski, ramen girl, hot tub time machine, old charles bronson flicks, kung fu movies from bruce lee to jet li, 12 monkeys, snatch, big trouble in little china, pan's labyrinth, i am a huge fan of zombie apocalypse films but i'll basically watch anything involving vampires and werewolves as well.  shows: community, parks&rec., the office, 30 rock, modern family, misfits, archer, dexter, breaking bad, californication, true blood, six feet under, deadwood, firefly, life on mars, anything involving hilarious british people in awkward social situations...  music: stoner rock, hip-hop, folk, electronica, reggae, progressive metal, industrial, classical, essentially anything that either makes my body move or sparks my emotions or both. my two all-time favorite albums: paul simon's graceland and the beastie boys check your head.  food: is very important, it sets my little world on fire. i'm pretty deep into chinese, thai, indian, mexican, italian, french, japanese, russian, middle eastern, irish, vietnamese, german and korean food. i love the smells of food. i love to cook. i love to eat. i'm always willing to try something new, but i refuse to eat anything that's looking up at me from and/or moving around on the plate.

you are a complex woman with healthy self-esteem. you are intelligent and funny. you are a great kisser. you are talented artistically or musically. you wanna hang out, grab a meal somewhere delicious, have a drink or maybe just make out like we're starring in an eighties movie and modern english's i melt with you is playing in the background.  don't message me if: you chew tobacco, you blatantly lied on your profile, you're really excited about your church, you think gay people are going to hell, you are easily offended by humor, you lack a basic sense of hygiene and/or chew with your mouth open."
11,"i was born in wisconsin, grew up in iowa, and moved to california three years ago for a combination of work opportunity and just wanting to live in sf. it took me a couple years to get to the peninsula, but i'm glad i eventually got here. i'm passionate about people and have a wide variety of interests and talents.  i'm also continually learning about myself. for example, i'm learning very recently that as a result of spending all my time growing up, in college, and for the last five years focusing on growing my ""deep relationship"" skills, i'm not as good as i previously thought at initializing friendships/relationships. i guess that isn't all a bad thing since the ""first impression"" thing only really happens once with each person. :)  as a result, i love my friends, i've got a lot of deep friendships, and know how much richer a friendship can get as it gets deeper.  i'm passionate about music, i play the guitar, write songs (less now than before), write plays (more now than before), want to learn french and asl, am pretty good for an amateur ballroom dancer, can do almost everything moderately well (seriously, no joke), love bright ties and shoes, am a jacket and jeans person, and absolutely love figuring out how people tick. i think i'm pretty cool and wish more people would be patient enough to take the time to see that.  every friend i've ever had say i'm nothing like anyone else. so i don't come off like anyone else. i'm my own person. and i'm proud of that.
i'm currently the youngest member on an internal strategy team for a large bank. it may sound boring, but i'm a big fan of the opportunities it entails. i get to be exposed to really intelligent, deliberately organized people be purposeful in a high paced business environment. it's pretty awesome soaking up all their knowledge while contributing what i can.  i'm happy with who i am and would enjoy adding someone else to the mix.
i'm really good at a little bit of everything. there isn't much i truly excel in, but i'm above average to good in almost every area. i take pride in being able to do a lot of different things. for example, i have a tiny bit of talent/skill in writing, wood-carving, cooking, singing, playing a guitar, drawing, sewing, etc. i grew up in a household that had to make a lot of the things we needed, so you kind of picked up these things along the way.
the way i dress. some days it's hats, other days it's different ties. most days it's shoes and jackets. just another way to express myself.  i've also decided that people notice how i'm not what they expected. i find myself unpurposefully continually surprising people, and i think i like that. :)
books = yes. avid reader. moves = eternal sunshine, vanilla sky, stranger than fiction, garden state, lord of the rings, star wars (the classics), etc tv = lost, himym, psych, big bang theory, etc music = brandi carlile, bon iver, band of horses, killers, etc -- i have a seriously wide range of musical tastes, not because i don't have taste but because i believe every genre has talented musicians food = sushi, bbq, italian--i like trying things, but often find myself coming back to the same old, same old
guitar - even if i don't play it all the time, i've got to have it as an available outlet corrective lenses - bats can see better than me if i don't have my glasses book - always reading--well, not as always as i used to, but still enough that i feel naked without a book in my bag ipod - got to have my music; 11,000 songs and counting. :d car - i really don't like being stuck at home--i don't mind being a homebody at times, but i don't like being forced to be money - i've found it's unbelievably hard to find fun things to do without spending money if you don't want to stay at home
a little bit of everything. but mostly social influences and how everybody's connected one way or another. there's a fascinating map of humanity out there, and it's interesting learning how people are influenced and how they influence.
hanging out with a small group of friends--staying in or going out--and just enjoying their collective company.
i'm picky when it comes to dating. i know what i'm looking for and won't waste my time. or hers.
if you know who you are, who you want, where your life is going. also, i'm a genuine guy who isn't going to be like everyone else. send me a message if you're patient, willing to take the time to get to know someone, and are looking for the kind of guy you can take home to your parents. :)"
16,"i just moved to the bay area from austin, tx (originally from louisiana). i do audio programming for video games, and just started at a game studio out here. yes, i am a bit of a nerdy programmer, but i don't have it stamped across my forehead - i don't even really play video games all that often. i actually create/play music way more often in my spare time.  i'm starting a new life here in ca and really excited about it. i only knew one person in this area when i moved here, but i wasn't worried - i always make friends pretty quickly. in every city i've lived, i've made at least a few life-long friends. i'm definitely looking to do the same thing here.  i'm a very easy to get along with kind of person. i always try to avoid over-complication. i have no time for bullshit, and i would expect the same from anyone i'm close to and/or respect.  i'm very much into doing things outside and living a healthy/fit lifestyle. i'm really looking forward to doing some camping, backpacking, biking, etc in ca. i also really enjoy going out for a nice meal and some tasty cocktails or beer, or doing the music nightlife thing. i dj (drum n bass) from time to time, and i've already landed a few gigs in the bay area. i'm very much involved in dnb and other electronic genres, but i love live music just as much.  basically ... life, to me, is about working hard and playing hard. i've made a lot of sacrifices and invested much effort to get myself into an industry where those two can often overlap, which is something i'm fairly proud of myself for. i've learned a lot of cool stuff so far and i plan to continue doing that. i'm pretty excited to see where that will take me :d
making music, programming, getting back into a fit lifestyle after an extended stay in louisiana, exploring the new city i just moved to.
i'm from louisiana, so cooking and eating are pretty much ingrained into my dna. there's a drinking factor involved as well.
lately, i keep getting asked ""are you with the band?"" i'm also going through several stages of ""you look like _"", and it's usually some musician i've never heard of. i guess it's the hair.
movies/tv/etc: the big lebowski (and other cohen bros. films), aliens, the foot fist way, the dark crystal, labyrinth, most guy ritchie films, most idiocracy, firefly, master pancake theater (austin comedy troupe), mitch hedberg, kids in the hall.  books: as far as fiction, i mostly read geeky stuff like fantasy and sci-fi. i also like reading books and articles on programming, game development, music creation, cooking, travel/outdoor, etc.  music: i'm into a very wide variety of music, ranging from experimental, downtempo, metal, drum n bass, techno, breakbeat, indian, jazz, ambient / soundscape, ... i could go on for days on this subject  food/beverage: thai, sushi, cajun, indian, mediterranean, mexican, bbq, espresso, cocktails, sake, red/white wine (mostly red)
(in no particular order)  - good food - music - the outdoors - tasty beverages - computing device - that blue stuff that you put your combs in
- methodologies for practicing creative skills - questioning ideas that have become widely adopted, but never intelligently discussed
i just moved here and am still getting to know the area, so i'm always looking for something to do. anything involving music and/or beer is always a good start.
i am in my 30's and still cannot grow a mustache. if i try, it comes out looking like a fischer price 'my first mustache'
you want to help me assemble ikea stuff and/or help me decorate my new place.  you wan to show me cool things to do in the bay area, or go exploring with me.  you think we might connect or want to know more about me."
17,"to sum myself in whole: i have adventurous tendencies with a somewhat vulgar flare (i hope you can take a joke-offensive or not).  i'm a constant seeker of discovering something new, whether it be a different restaurant, culture, or music (anything really). i tend to have an eclectic personality.  i volunteer and participate with a lot of activities with my community. i also tend to seek those who have a story, any story. i'm all ears! i want to learn from you, hear what you have to say, and relate it to my own personal experience.  i'm a bit of a nerd and like to watch the history, military, and discovery channel. something about militaristic strategies intrigue me.  i'm a bit of a tom boy, so i indulge in shooting guns, playing video games, and working out consistently. i also have the guilty pleasure of watching ridiculous comedy (family guy, curb your enthusiasm, it's always sunny ...just to name a few)
i'm currently studying and majoring in criminal justice, and i will be graduating soon :) (i'm stoked!). i have something lined up in the future that is awaiting for me pending graduation (i'll tell you later).  i'm currently working on a difficult project with school, which has me discovering different perspectives of san francisco's tenderloin district. i'm chatting with homeless people, prostitutes, drug addicts, and so far 1 ""john"". intereresting to say the least.
hmm...i know i can take a test rather well.;) ...ohh and i'm pretty good at playing tic-tac-toe by myself. i win all the time!  listening-people say that all the time, but i tend to think of this as somewhat a necessity. listening to another human being. tricky.  lots? the one skill i prize in: i'm really good at reasoning and rationally thinking. i find this to be extremely rare nowadays.  i'm really good at tinkering with things on the side, being that i crave discovery and self knowledge, so in a sense i'm good at figuring things out on my own.
physically-i've been told my eyes. people usually like how i can turn a serious situation into something relaxing and fun. i tend to make shy people ""talk"" to me...but i keep hearing that's a plus.
i'm much more of a movie goer. favorite actor: edward norton. favorite actress : rachel weise. favorite director: darren aronofsky . that should give you a pretty good idea of the type of movies i like.  i absolutely love to dance! nothing is a better stress reliever than hitting the dance floor with good company.  hands down though, my ultimate love affair with music is essentially classic rock. the scorpions are absolutely my favorite band because they bring a smile to my face every time i hear them. they were also the best concert i've ever attended.  best book i've read so far: the secrets of the fbi- by robert kessler. if you were obsessed watching the sopranos, i highly recommend this book!  favorite food? my taste for food is wide, however i can't deny my own culture ...so mexican food is probably what i like best. it always has that homely feeling to it.
my cellphone eye liner food wallet jacket a good excuse ;) -ponder about that one for a moment
my next big vacation! who knows....maybe if i like you enough you can tag along
working out at the gym, sometimes watching a movie, sometimes heading out with the roommates and friends to various sf bar locations, sometimes exploring different beaches at two in the morning (i know, i'm weird), sometimes getting up and 4:30 am to see the fog roll up on the golden gate bridge, and sometimes after i'm done with my workout...i'll run again. sometimes i'll do all of this in order on my friday night.....yeah, boom.
i could beat you at a game of hold em'.....try me :)  i like to eat raw lemons and limes i've tried to balance the light switch between on and off.  i have a daily case of dejavu. i still draw the sun at the corner of binder paper.  and...i love opera.
you're interested?  and you also thought ophelia was incredibly annoying when she ate those grapes from, ""pan's labyrinth""."
18,"some of my favorite things: riding my motorcycle on curvy roads curling up with the next book in the series finding great photographs building things joking around with my friends, finding funny moments the stars windy days living near the beach love and compassion music cooking dinner with a friend  sometimes i'll take a different route, just to see where it goes.  my photos are available on facebook, for a peak of some of those unguarded moments :p
enjoying it, exploring limits, looking for love
understanding, appreciating, i like getting a conversation going. i love teaching, and being creative.
blue eyes and a kind soul... although i don't really know that. i haven't asked anyone. i imagine it's what they're thinking about at the time: ""i could really go for a sandwich, oh wow, that guy's carrying a sandwich from the local deli... wow he has really blue eyes!"" so you know, maybe it's sandwiches.
i like stories that are adventurous, fun, and enjoyable. it's important to me that the artist poured their heart into the work, and stayed true to the characters and world they created. i'll read a book or two a week, so it's hard to pick a favorite!
compassion, love, art, my motorcycle, stretching after a nap, burritos
i like thinking about ways to improve things. it's my job actually, so that works out well :) things like how to make our software more efficient. i also like being creative, and exploring ideas for fun. my next project? building a custom wooden tool box that fits on my bookshelf.
last friday i had dinner with my roommates, and i bummed around on reddit. this friday, i'm motorcycle camping with some friends.
i have liked vampire novels ever since finding ""my babysitter is a vampire"" at the library when i was a little kid.
because i'll try to write back, and it's hard to get to know someone from a profile page.  also if you're a bit of a nerd and like joking around :)"
19,"i relocated to san francisco half a year ago. that was an awesome few months that let me explore the diverse parts of the city, find a gorgeous victorian house to live in, meet my awesome roommates who became my best friends, find my first american emotional soul-mates, ride hot european wheels on the hilly streets of san francisco and the winding road to stinson beach, swim in the freezing waters of the bay, walk the ocean beach at full moon on warm, starry nights, experience the great outdoors hiking and cross-country skiing, fall in love with the local diversity and openness, abundance of cuisine, and embracement of active lifestyle.  this is the most awesome city to live in, and one where you can loose yourself in a continuous chase of newelties and adventure. and the people around will only support you in that amazing run for new experiences. having been absorbing this atmosphere for the past six months, i'm finally revelling in the clamness that i find inside me once again. like you, maybe, and so many bright people here, i've come to embrace this city as home. and i'm beginning to stabilize and live a well paced life, with time for personal and professional growth, fun with close friends, sports that keep the balance of my body and mind, and with the time to ponder and reflect on my way through life.
i left my comfort zone far behind in europe, and enjoyed a few months of a fast-paced adventure here. at the same time i was doing my best to settle down and it seems it worked well ;-)  being in the central game-development technology hub, i'm taking advantage of the situation and am focusing a bit more on work & career too.

i'm pretty direct, so you can ask and i'll tell you.
you wanna meet up."
22,"i tend to think the same way a comedian does about nearly everything and i laugh more than any other particular activity. adventures are a key ingredient to my happiness, whether it be a new restaurant, hike, or sport i'm usually forging ahead toward something new. you coming?
i'm a supply and demand manager for a sustainable soap manufacturer here in sf. the typical corporation sort of sucks the life out of my being, so working for companies with a positive mission is key for me. aside from operations work, i am currently learning to cook (better), renting a cabin in tahoe for the season to ensure i take snowboarding more seriously, refreshing my spanish for travel, and taking wood-working classes.
making predictions, planning anything (i'm pretty thorough when motivated), writing, making people laugh (yes, often at me), and overeating/drinking followed by an appropriately guilty run through the park.
that i'm smiling. pretty much at all times.
a confederacy of dunces and infinite jest are two of my all time favorite books. in terms of movies i tend to love wes anderson flicks, fear & loathing, lebowski, you know, the usual. i'm a guy! for tv shows i am big on most hbo series, walking dead, and any solid comedies not on basic cable (yeah, no basic cable shows of any kind really).
1) sf restaurants, could they be any better? 2) friends with beer 3) going places i've never been 4) board sports 5) a bicycle 6) smartass comedy
how to build an empire and a legacy. so far the list is to obtain two atv's, two jet skis, and a giant trampoline to keep at my beach house. there will also be a baseball diamond. we will surf nearly every day and survive on a diet primarily consisting of tacos and beer. if you want to do something like this please contact me.
having beers with any number of friends and pretending that i just worked the last day of my life. aaaah, weekends.
when i was a kid i thought steven segal was really cool. please don't judge me.
you're a positive and creative personality looking for some new adventures."
23,"here's a completely fake summary i wrote while feeling coy: i like nature. you know like plants, sticks, stuff like that. if i like a girl, i'll do special things for her. like, i might wear a do-rag or maybe spray paint her car, little things. if i'm really crushin' on a girl, i'll light some incense, put on my fancy robe, and sing her kid rock songs while i cook us some hamburger helper.  ok, for real now: i'm a bit clumsy, but i'm an expert at silly dancing. i grew up in a ghost town and i like living simply. i enjoy subtlety, creativity, nostalgia, and quaint old-fashioned things. i make mistakes, but i always try to do the right thing. i am not a rich man, but i've got a heart of gold.  i am honest, good-natured, and the bee's knees
i'm an english tutor and i love my job.
i've made some really great art, music, and films, but i've also made a great deal of stuff that fits nicely into the garbage.
scandinavian blond hair. i mean, that's what *you* noticed, right? :)
books: oscar wilde, michael j nelson, and sir arthur conan doyle.  movies: blade runner, a clockwork orange, the shining + schindler's list. i love classic movies. fav. genre: giallo.  music: red house painters/sun kil moon, goblin, ariel pink, chromatics, joy division & unwound. i collect vinyl. fav. label: italians do it better.  food: i'm vegan, but i'm not a weirdo about it.  other stuff: nostalgia, animals, the twilight zone, twin peaks, mst3k, nes, avgn, tv carnage, tim and eric, william shatner, larry david, ricky gervais, nature, parks, and groucho marx.
minimalism
i have an eccentric, overactive imagination; i never get bored.
i'm an idler. i enjoy simple activities like a walk in the park, a bike ride, a dinner with a friend, or a movie at home. none of this bar hopping nonsense for me.

25,"hey to all, hope all is well and your having a great summer! i've been in denver and won't be back till the 12th or so. talk to you then.  i am currently work as a graphic designer focused on marketing and advertising. i graduated from the university of colorado at boulder class of '07. i am humble, energetic, willing, optimistic, honest and have a lot of gratitude. i live for today and in the moment and that is important to me. i believe in succcess without stepping on toes. i am positive and strive to be the best i can be.positivity and humor are key for me...laughter is my specialty.  i am looking to meet new friends and possibly something more. i have no expectations, but keep my eyes open for that special girl to see where it goes.  i consider myself to be a gentleman, but a child at heart with a lot of energy! i don't mean in an immature way, just a lot of fun and down to do anything. i was raised in a good family. i have been lucky enough to travel around the world and plan on keeping that up.  i enjoy japanese culture, oahu's beautiful oceans (north shore- waimea bay, pipeline, kailua, makapu, sandy's), music!!!, having my dog by my side, staying in and watching movies, dating sweethearts, my ipad and iphone, dining, traveling, snowboarding, fly fishing, camping, watching pro sports, aimlessly running around the city, watching movies in bed, taking you to the driving range, surfing with my older brother, cycling, going to shows in the city and going out with friends.
always with my dog or spending time with family or out with friends.   i do freelance graphic design and work as a veterinary technician/assistant.   i often take quick trips back and forth from ca to honolulu, hawaii to see my family and to relax. i always get a lot from every trip to the islands. i am spiritually grounded when i am there.   keeping things simple.
""living for today, in the moment""   socializing and killin' those awkward silences, by not being judgemental. i naturally relate to a wide wide range of people no matter who you are or what type of background you come from. can relate to more people than most. i have been through so much in my life and feel everyone deserves to express who they are, even if it's not on the first try.  when in a relationship and/or not:   hygiene (very important vice-a-versa)  if my girl is happy, then i'm happy.  honesty and trust  making decisions  always available 24/7  dress well  badboy syndrome with good qualities  keeping the honeymoon stage going.  competitive sports etc. (things i can teach or we can do together)   junior national us water polo team and played varsity polo all 4 years in hs.   i have been surfing since i was 4.   traveling basketball team(metro mirage)   played club soccer (world united)   played in many golf and tennis tournaments.   on the cu snowboard team in college and still love to ride in the winters.   i play on a competitive softball team and played baseball growing up.   i cycle often and was in my first 65mile race two months after my 1st ride.   fly fishing   progressive/innovative art  **i don't think i would enjoy my hobbies if i didn't feel i could perfect them**
i am easy to talk to and am not judgmental. if your happy, then i won't think your a square if you throw in a bunch of !!!! :) ;) don't ever worry about what you wrote, how long it is or how you write it. i will break the awkward silences in person and you will feel as if we knew each other for years, no matter who you are or what you say...guaranteed.

26,"full-time student, full-time square. i change from year to year. used to love computer games, and drinking, but am finding i hate them more as time passes. don't get me wrong. i still enjoy a night out every other month and a lazy saturday with my computer now and again. my obsession of the moment include long drives at night after work and hitting the gym. on the weekends i like to sit and home and prepare for the week ahead.
i'm currently studying at ccsf. i went to babson college, in wellesley, massachusetts, in 2008 but i was both unprepared to enjoy the experience and boston was too different from home (the philippines). decided to run away to san francisco, learn what i want, and move on to a better school when i find myself ready. here i am, 70 units later, anxious to make another leap. i work for square and couldn't have found a better first job.  in the near future i'm going to be working on helping my mom start a business in the field of her choosing and try to fit a semester working/studying in japan.
school, especially when there is a bet involved. swimming, but not as good as i used to be. typing (90-100 wpm). getting lost. making a sweet breakfast. meeting new people. jedi mindtricking children. finding stuff for cheaps. making sneaky drinks. panicking near hobos. fixing stuff. putting stuff together. most importantly: travelling.

28,"i moved here recently and love this place. i'm a half-urban, half-mountain guy, devoted to the walkable/bikeable/transit-rideable city, and to getting out in the wilderness to remember that it exists. i love this progressive free-thinking city, where people are active and politically active and whimsical. and where i hear people speaking a dozen languages every time i get coffee/get on bart/go anywhere.  so far, i've been a biologist, a science teacher, a traveler, an outdoor adventure guide, and a couple other things. i'll stay the teaching route for the moment while i figure out my path in to working on some kind of sustainability policy or work for ensuring accurate science education.  i laugh out loud.  i'm a balance of things: intellectual and active and creative. i'll geek out over a scientific journal, then go do some work on a sculpture or painting. days need some active time: riding bikes, walking places, helping out friends or friends-of-friends with moving or fixing things (i genuinely love this; i need something useful to do with my hands). i stay in shape and care about being fit so i can be healthy and strong enough to do the things i like to do.  i'm fun, driven, bright, grounded, comfortable with myself. i hope you are too. also, i'm grown up, you know? i'm emotionally available and mentally healthy. i don't play hot and cold games or try too hard to charm you / get obsessive / chase you when you're a little out of reach. i'll respect you as my equal. i have two little sisters so i'm well aware a lot of men play the charmer/politician act, and also keep a collection of women on strings. as i told my sobbing, heartbroken littlest sis at christmas, those dudes are what they are, and they're not gonna change. and i don't want to be them.  basically, i'm happy to be out here. it feels like there's so much to explore and i'd love to explore it with someone smart and energetic who's been here maybe over a year and can show me around. outdoorsy would be great, but it isn't a requirement for dating. be extremely passionate and driven about something you care about, that's all.
settling into a new city, figuring out how bio and sustainability and education and urbanism and sculpture and travel are all going to intersect. :-)  maybe growing a beard. profusion of lazy-stubble this week. would i turn immediately into a hipster or is that only true if the beard is ironic?
making stuff, thinking about stuff and doing stuff. laugh-milk-out-your-nose-funny banter.
depends. i've been told my eyes (isn't this the part where i'm supposed to tell you they're ""piercing"" and that's supposed to be good?)  uh... if i've just come back from a camping trip, probably they notice that i'm scruffy and covered in dirt. don't worry, i clean up nice.

i'm a sucker for pictures/youtube videos of baby animals (cute overload ftw). i'm even worse than my six year old niece. i blame her total lack of attention span.
you're bright, funny, creative and interesting, driven, passionate. maybe you like to be outside and to travel. you like to laugh with and at each other. you're incredibly-awesome but real -- you don't have to pretend around me, you know? you want someone healthy and grounded, not obsessive. you're together and grounded yourself, but that doesn't mean you're never going to have a crappy day or melt down or cry all over yourself/my shirt, and that's okay and healthy. i want you to be human. cause i'm probably gonna have to be human too, and it's way more fun with company. :-)"
31,"to life, love and loot  i like smart, funny, and strong woman. i have been called picky. i think its a consequence of being honest.  i'm a boston convert. i've been in sf for 3 years and have explored as much as i can, but theres plenty of more to do.  my life plan: (1) bust my ass creating a company (2) sell it or ipo (3) take mini-retirements around the world (4) use my time exactly how i want... travel, create more companies, invest or something i haven't thought of yet
im a founding partner and product manager at a sf start-up. and i just moved into a home/office 30 seconds from the beach.  m-f: if i'm not working, i'm sleeping or out on the beach. if i have time, responding to people on okcupid  sat-sun: napa, trying out a new restaurant, beers with friends, comedy show, movie. and yeah, working
making people laugh :)  or making an ass out of myself. sometimes they're one in the same.
my eyes. they're very green.
i love tv, i love movies, and i love to read.  theres a lot of great entertainment out there if your tastes are open enough.  right now i'm reading: game of thrones  i just finished the hunger games series and the tales of lisbeth salander and mikael blomkvist. an nlp introductory  watching: alcatraz, how i met your mother, the young turks, and arrested development again  movies: last i watched: 21 jump street  favorite movies... a lot of them. limitless, there's something about mary, lucky number s7even, fight club, the social network, the hangover, crazy stupid love
1. great food 2. big dreams 3. people smarter then myself 4. the internet :) 5. beautiful women 6. sleep... a good nights sleep can be amazing (i love my new bed btw)  and 7. why 7? because i like to go one step beyond.  7. the people in my life
design, art, politics, movies, games, food!!  i have 2 dreams at night i go to...  (1) having a stopwatch that could freeze time (2) zombies ate my neighbors! how do i survive?
working with friends while having a beer trying out a new restaurant napa or sonoma at a movie drinks in the city

if you like good conversation.  it may not end in a date, but we can find something to laugh about"
33,"""apparently,"" has become a new favorite word of mine, like ""perpendicular."" it's fun to say don't you think? do you have any favorite words?  perrrr piiinnn diiic uuulaarrr  as naturally for myself, i'm laid back, ummm... witty, and uber sarcastic. i cannot really describe myself without the fear of sounding... vain. always been a happy chick and i tend to have a good time everywhere i go and i also tend to dance out of nowhere. it's my thang, ya dig? what comes after happiness? humor? sure, humor. it's a little dark, a little vulgar, and it involves making fun of myself and my friends. have you ever played ""your team?"" i appreciate everything in life. my friends, my family, my co-workers, a blanket, nature, the city. psh! even those creepy crawlies! i also say thank you a lot because i enjoy making others feel appreciated and important. it totally boosts their esteem up! it makes me happy!  i swear too much by the way. hehe.  can't think of anything else. i was born and raised in norcal??  let's be friends or whatever.
working at a doggy daycare. it's really fun and i love it! hanging out with my friends, riding my bike around town, laughing, hugging, coming home with sand in hair, laying in the grass enjoying the sunlight. & spending too much time, money and gas in the eternal land of san francisco and on concerts.  trying to become a zoologist! ! !
being a girl... cooking vegetarian cuisine and top ramen, piecing things together, being right, puzzles, being that one supportive friend, bantering with my best friend, making fun of my friends, sometimes knowing how to fix a computer, fitting in your pocket, being optimistic, taking bad pictures of you, loving everyone, not hating everyone, freaking out at cute animals like baby ducks.
people start speaking to me in spanish and i respond in english. fo' real, it's my hair then my height then my eyes then my lips on my face then my laid-back personality and positive energy.
everything, yo. i really enjoy non-fiction stuff, for example, memories & biographies. as well, fiction stuff, drama & mystery. i'm not picky. movies are tough becauuussee i don't watch them all that often. i'm serious. it takes major convincing to make me watch a movie. i pretty much like them all, even the cheesy kinds. except epic movie, that movie was fucking terrible. shows: 30 rock, any 90s cartoon & show, parks & rec but i don't watch shows all that much either. i haven't watched tv in 4 years. i have netflix though. music: obsessed with arcade fire (again), death from above, beirut, animal collective, boys noize, cocorosie, coldplay, spokane, daft punk, mstrkrft, justice, fever ray, crystal castles, fake blood, fleet foxes, friendly fires and anything 80s!  i ain't picky with food but i don't like mexican. edit on mexican: i had a freakin' lengua super taco in the mission and it was delicious. that's probably the closet thing i'll ever like about mexican food.
i can't choose. please don't let me choose... fine  my best friends, education, acai juice, watching my dog sleep, san francisco, my guilt for deep fried food.  sandwiches.
what daydreamers only think about.  moving to sf or portland. mostly portland. yeah, definitely portland.  grad school in sydney. living life in toronto then returning back to california and live in sf forever and having my best friend be my neighbor.
it varies! i work on my friday nights but if there is something going then most likely i will suck it up and go to that event. i really love going to off the grid and stuff my face while drinking a good beer. raving clubbing  cuddling with my puppy  or just chilling out, watching a show or movie with my best friend.
i turn 21 on july 1st. give me money and gifts. (jaykay)  i have a whip in my car.  i saw 2 of my former high school teachers on this site once. it was awkward.
you wanna get guatemalan food with me in the mission.  you like super tacos  you wanna be friends. you wanna make out. you wanna dance with me. you wanna have adventures. you wanna day drink. you wanna rave. you wanna laugh.  you wanna do whatever is fun.  you think i'm pretty? i hope you don't find me intimidating because i'm really not."
37,"let's go to a festival and dance all night... running and dancing with the stars. we will not rest until our naked bodies have melted away and the awesome beauty of life, death, and the universe becomes so clear. after which we will finish that bottle of jameson and hold each other close, laughing at our friends and welcoming the sunrise. a new day of adventure awaits.  i am looking for many things: friendships, drinking/hiking/sports buddies, love interests, adventure partners, business opportunities... you name it. i am a social animal and appreciate human interaction, so i am always interested in meeting new people regardless of ""who"" or ""what"" they are. in practice, and in mannerisms, i seem like quite the ""typical"" guy: i love to drink beer, play sports, i listen to reggae, dubstep and hip-hop, and enjoy a beach full of bikini-clad women as much as anyone. however, yes, i can also be a bisexual, swinging, polyamorous, and debaucherous individual. but that is just a part of me, and all that really means anyway is i'm open minded. i have always fully imagined marrying and having kids one day, but i'm open to whatever life may bring. while i am secretly and totally a hopeless romantic, i am not trying to rush in to things or grow up too fast. i strive in my daily life to be relaxed and down-to-earth, but still adventurous... i try not to take the day-to-day of life too seriously. :-)  a note on ""bisexuality"": for you hetero-normative folk: do not be afraid of the term ""bisexual"". it is just a term, and a very limiting one at that. i am just as heterosexual as a ""straight man"". i am just as homosexual as a ""gay"" man. and just because i may be bisexual and perhaps polyamorous, does not mean that i am unable to be in a happy, committed, and fulfilling relationship with a single partner. in fact, such an arrangement has been my norm.
i am living. bartending, schooling, rocking out to my radio... seeking new adventures and opportunities around every corner!
... taking the experience of getting lost and transforming it in to a beautifully drunken day of adventure.
... is that i am laughing... because life is ridiculous.
humph. where to begin? i like comedies that make me laugh and dramas that make me feel. i like books that make me think and music that makes me want to walk-down-to... electric avenue!  i don't watch tv really ever, but i grudginly admit there a couple shows out there that are pretty entertaining.  and food? i love food. i'll eat almost anything that's not seafood (i know, how tragic)  question: do people really read this section? i can't imagine judging someone based on a list of books and movies...
love friendship music burning man passion hot and sour soup
how to make the world a better place. and that usually starts with how do i develop in to a better person.  i also tend to get songs stuck in my head way too often. :-)
there is no typical friday: i could be at an outdoor festival in golden gate park, dancing my ass off to pretty lights, or i could be watching a movie at home with the roomies. sometimes i like to go out to shows, clubs, and bars. other times i like to kick it at home with close friends, chilling hard, talking, drinking, plotting, and dreaming.
i am hesitantly giving this whole online dating thing a try.
if you want to go to a festival and dance all night... running and dancing with the stars. we will not rest until our naked bodies have melted away and the awesome beauty of life, death, and the universe becomes so clear. after which we will finish that bottle of jameson and hold each other close, laughing at our friends and welcoming the sunrise. a new day of adventure awaits."

39,"i love life!  oh. okcupid is telling me that three words isn't enough. ok then:  i just moved to the bay area in february, i don't know anyone here. this is your chance - you can pretend to be the coolest kid in town and i won't know any better but to believe you!  still not enough? fine... a more detailed description of me:  born to lead the armies of darkness to ruinous victory. gifted with a vast range of abilities for achieving that destiny. cursed by the forces of good to be crippled by ethics, honesty, and compassion. the usual story - good triumphs over evil, foiled again, blah blah blah.  i can read and write my name, and i have a job and a home and a car and my teeth and i can use an oscilloscope and i can shower myself!  you should also know that of all the people on a recently-published ""50 most loathsome people in the usa"" list, not a single one of them is me. your mom will be delighted to hear this. (though you may feel a little bit insulted by her poorly hidden relief.)
design, adventure, tools, competitive latin dance, electronics, events, going out, ballroom competitions, hiking, games, parties, diy, travel, museums, invention, making stuff!  by day, i'm a mild-mannered designer in an office. by evening, an inventor, artist, and adventurer. by night, a competition dancer and jet-setter to fun and glamour.  ""oh - you're a designer?"" you say. ""that's interesting!"" you lie. exactly! ""designer"" is a great thing to be, because you can put it on forms and stuff to answer the ""what do you do?"" question without actually answering it. ""designer"" tells you nothing. i could be working in fashion, cars, systems, furniture, ads, events, landscapes, websites, aircraft, or anything! ""ah yes, very clever, haha etc etc. so what kind of designer are you then?"" well, some of you reading this will have purchased my work. that kind of designer :-p
most things :-p
the first thing people usually comment on is my accent. i sound british to most americans, australian to some, but while these are good guesses, neither is quite correct.  someone else's summary of me: ""he is not only hot as hell, but he is the gayest straight man in the world - he has good taste, knows how to decorate, has a real sense of style"".  clearly she completely failed to notice my impressive aura of menace and seductive evil radiating across the land. actually, no-one seems to notice it. i think my aura might be broken.  a friend i met on this site just called me ""a rare gem in the wasteland of okstupid"". i hope there is a gem around here somewhere for me!
i like books & movies & music, just like you!  i'm not actually much of a believer in seeking out only people that you have lots in common with. it might be easier to go on a date if you're both always wanting to see the same movies, but i think the really great times are often the ones where you end up doing something you've never done before (and never dreamed you would), because the other person's different interests give you access to worlds that you probably wouldn't stumble into without them. through each other, you both end up more magnificent!
i have whatever is the opposite of chronic depression - i am pretty much hardwired to remain happy, regardless of what is going down. so i figure i won at least one of life's major lotteries.  on a different tack, i once lost mobility due to my leg being sliced open when i accidentally... er... i mean... in the midst of battle while i was fending off dozens of those bad guys from the lord of the rings films. yeah - dozens! anyway, i got so sick of not being able to do stuff, that i eventually ended up at a big new year's bash a few weeks later, dancing through the painkillers, doing my leg no favours, but having a blast. thus, i think dancing would probably be on the list. as to the other four things, they're classified. may i see your security clearance please? wait - you're telling me you don't have a security clearance? sir/maam, this is a restricted area. if you would like clearance, you will need to step over here for the security screening...
i like the often refreshingly blunt and uncomfortable insights about us that are laid bare by oktrends.  on the subject of oktrends, you might notice that my profile says i'm 6'2"" tall. but if we measure in okcupid inches, i'm nearly 6'4""! we know this because oktrends cleverly deduced that men here inflate their height by an average of 2"", while i happen to know that i only inflated mine by a fraction of an inch, so as to get a round number. (clearly i'm a rebel, living dangerously! or something).
once upon a time i might have been out conversing and dining with friends, but then i moved here where i don't know anyone. perhaps i'd be out dancing somewhere. perhaps at home, working on secret projects. ask me.
you wouldn't believe me anyway, so nevermind. :-p  random fact: i was bitten by a (presumably) radioactive insect, exploring the exclusion zone at chernobyl. any day now i'll discover my super-powers. any day...  another (not very) secret: i get lower auto insurance premiums than you - despite being male and having a (very) fast car. how is that fair? well, there's a trick to it... but i plan to get an electric car and build my own solar powerplant to help fuel it. (i've done a bunch of smaller solar projects. i love the permanence of it - building something that can run forever - the other parts will fail before the power source does.)
you're participating in the human trials of the oragenics bacteria(1) - i would totally snog(2) someone with that stuff in their mouth; a life of crime doesn't get much sexier than stealing the latest experimental biotech via steamy french kiss, and committing swathes of intellectual property infringements with tongues entwined.  (1) oragenics is an experimental version of the bacteria that causes tooth decay, but engineered to out-compete (and thus kill) the normal strain, while at the same time, not creating tooth decay. in theory, the new strain should stop decay for the rest of your life.

40,"i am new to the san francisco bay area and looking for new friends and people who would like to introduce me to their favorite places.  -inglorion- is...  - yet another friendly guy stuck in front of a computer  - ... and liking it!  seriously, i am a computer programmer (both profesionally and as a hobby), so naturally i spend quite some time at my computer. but there are so many fun things in life that this page couldn't possibly contain them all. just to name a few, i like sailing, speaking foreign languages, cycling, taking walks, parties, and hugs.  i also spend some effort trying to make the world a better place, caring for the environment, conserving energy, thinking about politics and animal rights (including human rights), and, by writing open source software that anybody is invited to use, share, and improve. more about that on my website: http://inglorion.net/  i'm always looking forward to making new friends and having fun together. if you're up for that, too, don't hesitate to send me a message!  i am humorous, considerate, and sometimes passionate  (note: i've started over answering the match questions. this will take a while.)
i write software for fun and profit. i complain about what's wrong with the world, and think about making things better.
i like to think am good at communicating, making friends, understanding people, making people feel appreciated, making them smile when they are feeling down, sharing my happiness, and physical displays of affection and love.  it hasn't always been this way, but i've worked to develop these skills, and i think it's paid off.
i wear funny t-shirts (they have funny and/or insightful quotes and/or images on them). that's what people used to notice, but i haven't heard that in a while. nowadays, people mostly notice i have a beard. maybe i should shave it so people will look at the rest of me again?  as an aside, i think this question is best written by other people. so if you have any suggestions for what this part _should_ say, please do not hesitate to tell me.
books: almost anything fantasy: the lord of the rings (tolkien); the wheel of time (sadly, robert jordan passed away before completing it), the death gate cycle (weis & hickman); memory, sorrow and thorn (tad williams); riftwar legacy (raymond e. feist), ... also the da vinci code (dan brown).   movies: avatar, dark city, the game, inception, monty python and the quest for the holy grail, memento, pay it forward, ghost in the shell, and inside man. i also like cartoons; watching them and being enchanted by them feels like being a child all over again. mostly, i like to watch movies together with other people, so if there is a movie you are really excited about, send me a message and maybe we can go see it together.   music: i like various music styles, although i have a low tolerance for the likes of rap and hip hop. i usually listen to: classical music (mozart, beethoven, charpentier); symphonic rock (or maybe goth rock) (nightwish, within temptation, evanescense); punk (satanic surfers, bad religion, hladno pivo); folk music (the dubliners, saban bajramovic); dance (milk inc), techno (basshunter) and some mixed or harder to classify styles (zdob si zdub, haggard, dropkick murphys). i also like the - funny yet insightful - songs by tom lehrer. and man should certainly be in this list!   food: i like most of the food i've tasted in my life. i also like to cook, sometimes, especially for someone special. i love asian (especially thai and chinese) food. i don't like liver, mamaliga, yoghurt, and probably a couple of other things.
happiness, fun, friends, hugs, fresh air, and the internet  i've lived extensive periods without these (sometimes lacking all of them at the same time), so, obviously, i _can_ do without them, but these things are so central to my life that missing one makes me feel incomplete.
life, the universe, and everything. me, my friends, and everyone else. programming, politics, and philosophy. the past, the present, and the future. i think (and fret) a lot. :-)  i care (and thus think) about fairness, the environment, animal rights, and programming languages.  my dream is to one day create a programming language that is suitable for interactive use and for writing large projects, and which is safer (in terms of mistakes one can make) and more flexible (or powerful) than languages in common use today. i have it all but figured out.
doing the same thing i do every night. in my case, that's not taking over the world, but trying to make my world a better place, which will hopefully improve it for other people as well. for example, i maintain a website (http://inglorion.net/) with essays about things i feel people should know, and links to pages that i feel deserve more attention.
hmm, so you want to know my little secret, ey? well, i believe that, especially in relationships, the problem is often too _little_ openness, so i am more into telling as much as possible as accurately as possible, and sooner rather than later. there are really only 2 reasons i keep secrets:  1. because they involve other people. unless i know they are ok with it, i try not to bandy about things that they would rather keep private.  2. because i want to keep it for later. for example, i am not going to tell you what is in your present until you've opened it.  as for all the weird and wonderful things i haven't told you yet...if you are interested, send me a message and start discovering! :-d
you should message me if...well, if you feel like it, really. there is no reason not to, really, unless you're really not interested in me at all. i love to get messages from people. :-d  some reasons you might want to message me (in no particular order):  - you live near me and would like to meet up. i like making new friends!  - i checked out your profile, but didn't write you a message. this probably means i intended to write to you, but lacked the time or was too tired. working full-time makes me that way. :-(  - you found something on my profile that you would like to talk about. for example, an interest we have in common, or something you agree or disagree with.  - you thought of a reason that you think should be listed here, but isn't."
43,"i don't really like summarizing myself; but who does, right? seems like every time i try i come up with a pile of contradictions. i'm a shy extrovert i'm a grounded dreamer i'm a lazy adventurer i'm open-minded, but sometimes stubborn i'm a city person, i'm a mountain man i can be very competitive, but try to avoid competition i'm very social, i'm a bit misanthropic i'm generally very meticulous, i'm often sort of careless i have a strong sense of self, i'm a social chameleon i have complete confidence in myself to succeed at whatever i do, yet i'm often terrified of failure/letting others down. a lot of my best friends didn't like me when they first met me. but when they took the time to get to know they figured out that i'm actually a very caring, entertaining, giving, honest, loyal, patient, playful, open, and stimulating companion. of course others love me at first sight and never stop. so maybe you should just see for yourself.  i am clever, creative, and complicated
spending a lot of time building things. a business, a house, and lots of other little things. trying to make the world a better place in small but perceptible ways. meeting new people, spending time with friends, looking for new adventures. my latest adventure is that i bought a house that most people would consider uninhabitable, but i'm moving in anyway. now if i could only find time to work on it.
designing and making things using my hands. thinking of creative solutions to problems (but i'm not so good at identifying problems) coping with chaos
i've never figured out the answer to this question. it really depends on who the other person is and what i'm doing when they meet me.
books: almost anything by vonnegut or steinbeck, recently enjoyed reading dave eggers' s.w.o.h.g., a few murakami books, 100 years of solitude, time traveller's wife, the art of happiness, world according to garp, tibetan book of living and dying  movies: (an incomplete sampling in no particular order) fight club, jacob's ladder, ferris bueller, fish called wanda, true romance, blazing saddles, cool hand luke, donnie darko, amores perros, y tu mama tambien, harold & kumar, shawshank redemption, altered states, baraka, my neighbor totoro  music: (roughly in order) electronica, indie, 80s new wave & alternative, breaks, old school hip-hop, bhangra remixes, some house, jazz, classical, classic rock sometimes  food: cheese! followed closely by mushrooms, bacon, and butter. my favorite restaurants are generally indian, sushi, thai, mexican and pizza. i'm always ready to try something new.

there is no typical night for me. sometimes at home designing/building, at dinner with friends, out dancing, on my way to the mountains, playing games or cards with friends, out on a date, eating pie and reading, watching a movie
i have no secrets i won't tell you, but you have to ask the right questions (caveat: i won't tell you other people's secrets, only my own)
...you're still reading. at least say hello.  especially if this comes close to describing you... you never want to stop expanding your mind, learn a new skill, a new language, read about new things, and try them. you are a dreamer and a doer.  you are an adventure seeker. and you find them wherever you go. sometimes the small ones like the impromptu bonfire on the beach or exploring an abandoned building, sometimes the big ones like taking off to travel for a few months. life excites you and always will. this world is an amazing place and although it's too big for anyone to see in entirely, you're excited to try. you're looking for someone like me who shares that energy, that curiosity, that lust for life that burns inside you, because adventures are often more fun when shared with others.  you live your life out of the mainstream, but not averse to jumping in every now and then to see what the rest of the kids are doing. you think about everything from morality to the nature of reality and have your own views on topics instead of blindly following social conventions.  you have made mistakes in your life. you learn from them and move on.  you are beautiful inside and out. not in the stuart smalley ""i'm good enough and i'm smart enough and gosh darnit, people like me"" way. you know from the depth of your being that you are an amazing individual and you're looking for someone who can appreciate everything you are. you probably still worry sometimes about what people think of you, but that's only because you surround yourself with other intelligent, creative, interesting, physically fit people like yourself. who doesn't occasionally get intimidated in that company?  you appreciate the physical beauty of the human body. you are a very sensual being. human touch is very important. hugs, kisses, massage, and sex. people skirt around the topic of sex all the time, but lets face it, sex is a very important aspect of a relationship for someone like you or me and there's no point wasting our time in a situation where the sex is less than phenominal. i'm excited to hear about your turn-ons and fantasies.  money is not really an issue for you - not because you're obscenely rich, that's not really important. i just mean that you have no trouble making the life you want for yourself. you appreciate that we are a very gifted, fortunate people to live as we do.  you give back to this wonderful community you live in.  you love to keep in shape by doing things, as opposed to just going to the gym for an hour a day. mt biking, rock climbing, surfing, kite surfing, running, hiking, snowshoeing, telemark, snowboarding, road biking, swimming, tai chi, qigong, and yoga all sound interesting to you even though you haven't tried them all yet. maybe you won't even like all of them, but at least you're excited to give them all a try.  you are not a serial monogomist. you are independent and comfortable being alone. it's fun to date and meet new people, but you're not going to settle for anything less than you deserve. ultimately you crave a relationship you can commit to for the rest of your life. you are looking for a loving relationship based on good communication and trust.  eventually you might want a family, but you're in no hurry."
48,"i love it here, except when it's hotter than a camel's hump. at that point, i just have to jump in a pool and get wet. i love the coooooooool cool waters of the greenbelt. i spend a lot of time with my head in the clouds. sometimes....i think about ann hathaway receiving sex in her butt hole. (bess celeb joke ever)  i usually split my time between austin and portland, but i like to travel all around the dang place.

i'm a go-getter, but i'm also a world class relaxer. i'm happy living in the woods, and happy working in the city as a digital artist.  i believe we can have it all.  i am looking to meet a kind and happy spirt that feels the same.
serving delicious food. telling entertaining stories. listening intently. working hard and enjoying it. figuring out how things work. being up for adventures. laughter.
my eyes, my sense of humor, my impeccable taste in friends and associates.  also that i am cool :)
this is a funny section, because these things won't matter much if we really click. if i really like you, i will probably find it endearing that you like things i don't. who knows, we may even broaden each others horizons.  adventure. magazines. historical pictures. diy guides.  twin peaks. deadwood. breaking bad. mad men. secrets from a stylist. modern family. the colbert report.  music and movies? hell yes. let's go anytime.  csa veggie box. oysters. anything cooked over fire. beer. wine. cocktails. ceviche. al pastor. curries. homemade pickles.
hoodies--6 of them at least.
the littlest things are catapulting me into daydreams of far away and close places. i could go just about anywhere right now. i want camp fires in the foggy north coast. hot springs in the andes. dusty climbing in the southwest desert. rum punch and dancing in the caribbean. and you are there too. and we can't wipe the smiles off our faces, but we wouldn't try anyway.
friday nights are not typical. monday, perhaps, is a creature of habit, but friday is a lady of mystery and intrigue. sometimes she wants to dance the flamenco, and others she wants to curl up at home by the fire. either way, i'm in.

52,"i'm a free culture nerd. i travel, talk, and teach.
i've been rock climbing a lot lately. i've been in and out of the city constantly, traveling random places in the world, and hope to continue that for a while. i always try to find a fun place to climb wherever i go.
ping pong, mixing cocktails, and cooking.
my eyes or maybe my charisma, depending on what setting i'm in.

you are interested in hanging out somewhere in san francisco."
59,"when it comes to my own life, i do as i please, but i am generous to friends and loved ones. i am loyal to a fault and a fun-loving guy on the surface but below lingers much, much more.  i am adventurous, optimistic, and open-minded.
i read books, soak up as much sun as humanly possible, i look forward to new adventures by myself or with good friends, i push the credo of diy to the max. i am curious about everything so i like to figure out how people and things operate. in the past year i've done a bit of traveling, took swimming classes, done day trips around the bay area on my bike, and maintained a volunteer bike educator position at a mission non-profit.
conversation, analyzing movies, spelling and grammar (but i'm not a grammar nazi), laughing at myself as well as absurdity.
people generally can't discern my ethnicity...i get hawaiian, samoan, or any other variety of pacific islander a lot and on occasion got half-black and (insert guess here). my friends comment on how approachable i am.
a short list:  the awakening of intelligence, one hundred years of solitude, the stranger, the unbearable likeness of being, meditations of marcus aurelius, on the road, edgar allan poe, pablo neruda.  the dreamers, irreversible, city of god, city of lost children, delicatessen, 2046, 8 and a half, snatch, trainspotting, the princess bride, harold and maude, vertigo, 12 monkeys, the killing fields.  muse, roger sanchez, dieselboy, pearl jam, led zeppelin, radiohead, beck, kings of leon, css, ingrid michaelson, buena vista social club, sublime, my morning jacket...  i am a foodie...i give everything a chance!
my bicycle, my cell phone, my laptop, food and water (obviously), laughter, and a good book.
finding balance in all aspects of my life. also, i continuously daydream of exploring far off lands, whether it is lazing about on a beach or treading through a southeast asian jungle
i jumble in between extremes a ton. at the root of my psyche, i am a dive bar with a whiskey and beer kind of guy. however, i'm just as comfortable at home with a book or on my xbox or an some after hours spot dancing to what the dj is spinning. i hate doing the same thing more than once but sometimes i can't get enough of the same thing.
i list dirty dancing as one of my deep down, guilty pleasures.  ""nobody puts baby in a corner.""
-you like bike riding. if you're a swimmer, that's awesome too! -you are a bit of a geek who doesn't mind getting her hands dirty. librarian glasses are a plus! -you are defined by more than what you do with your life. my collection of friends are serious in their careers but know how to have fun too. i don't have many expectations but this would definitely be one of them. -you like going out and are not a perpetual homebody. -you daydream of travel as well! :)"
63,"i'm from bucks county, pa. when i was a kid, i could walk to the end of my street and feed cows. over time i watched the area give way to suburban sprawl, and i'll bet that's where my desire to preserve, maintain, and help out began. since then, i've lived in philly, costa rica, and now the gorgeous west coast. the things that are really important to me are: my friends, my hobbies (photography, cooking, gardening), my health, creative expression, doing something that helps people, my students, sustainable food, urban agriculture, intellectual stimulation, spiritual development, laughter, peace.
english teacher, studying hypnotherapy, founder and active member of a community garden club, part time professional photographer. i would really love to live on a farm someday.<--- yes. my true dream among dreams is to find my guy, run away, and live a beautiful rustic down home country life that still has access to big city jobs and nightlife/culture. is that asking too much?
teaching, photography, going after what i want, creative projects, cooking, pie eating contests (1st place at the county fair when i was 10, bitches), conversation, dancing and having a good time. i'm sort of a jack of all trades in that i can do a lot of things relatively well, but still not sure where my true passion lies. not so good at filling out questionnaires about myself.  look at some of my photos here, if you'd like http://www.flickr.com/photos/-nicspics-/
probably my high energy and curly hair.
yikes what an exhausting question. i usually have at least 5 books checked out of the library at any given point in time. i do love kurt vonnegut and jon krakauer. i think orwell was a genius. i have an active and growing record collection and one of the things i really like to do is get lost in amoeba. i especially dig soul, classic rock, and bluegrass. as for food, again i like it all and cooking is a big hobby for me. yeah, this is a cop out for the question. i could list a gazillion items, but why? just ask me. better yet, let's go pick out a record together, and then listen to it with a glass of wine. outstanding.
my friends, a camera, a record player, a garden or access to one, a lap top, and coffee.
the next big adventure. how to transform neglected pieces of public land into active gardens. how i can combine everything i love to do into one super mega ultra job. how can i best use my energy and skills to help out? can i inspire others to do the same?
up to no good.
i geek out on zombies, sci fi, and conspiracy theories. whew felt good to get that off my chest. also, sometimes i can be really spacey. it can be embarrassing, really. sometimes i will straight up zone out and go into la la land and not hear a word you say. im just an avid daydreamer and always have been. just snap your fingers as hard as you can in front of my face and that should clear up the problem right quick :-)
you are an open minded and curious person who won't be weirded out by abstract conversations."
65,"i really like meeting new people. small-world networks fascinate me.  beer is important. without beer, there would be no civilization.  somehow i can only sing spanish, but not speak it. i suppose music is the universal language?  coffee enthusiast.  why am i the only one singing when riding my bike around the mission?
i'm a scientist of sorts, doing some interesting things at a startup downtown. i love it, ask about it if you like. signal processing - machine learning - vision - data (all sizes)
talking, if you get me on the right subject. escalators (both directions). retweeting. coming up with terrible-joke paper titles (that we then actually use in publication).
i am a coffee nerd.  ojal que llueva caf!  locally brewing/drinking four barrel - ritual - verve - de la paz - wrecking ball (when i can get my hands on it) i typically prefer to brew out of a sock (well, no, not that kind of sock).
food: i'm not a strict vegetarian but i don't eat mammals. i love bread so i bake it (there is usually some pte fermente hiding in my fridge). a foodie.  books: from bauhaus to our house, anything by philip roth, the information (at least for its historical content), hayek, orwell's 'politics and the english language.'  music: tom waits, radiohead, grizzly bear, beck, cafe tacuba, dr. dog, neutral milk hotel, sigur ros, & 90s alternative (pumpkins, etc.).  tv: 30 rock, parks&rec, the league, community, southpark, peep show (the britcom :/ ), madmen, portlandia, colbert, a few competition shows, e.g., top chef. i watch shows that are available on hulu or the web.  i do like movies but never remember which. surely anything by the coen brothers. lately i've been having a lot more respect for nicolas cage (see here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp1-oquwol8).
wikipedia coffee bread, bagels, and the other canonical starches music good conversation friendsgiving
i think last names are interesting.  lately i've been thinking a lot about what kinds of fun features i can build into our product at work.
baking challah, then usually out with friends. if you've never tried it, avocado is an optimal pairing for challah.  an ideal typical night involves beer and good company. i like beer bars like toronado/sycamore/beer revolution/the trappist, local bars like shotwells/evelyn, and any cocktail place that does it right, you know, like its 1890 (e.g., the hideout/15 romolo/alembic).  really though, why wait for friday? any night of the week can be good for going out or doing something interesting at home with friends. soapbox party?
i watch sytycd.
you want to - check out a food pop-up - introduce me to a really great beer bar that i may not have yet found (or bakery for that matter) - get a cup of coffee - find out more  or a bike adventure around the city!"
67,"above all else i am, and always have been, a good girl. being a good girl is everything. it means being honest and true. it's beyond conventional definitions of being good; it's being real, whole and more than anything else being present. it's more than simply ""being"" good; it is rather being available as you really are, never someone you're trying to be. it's having a raw kind of vulnerability and commitment that few people actually attempt. it means pushing beyond your old comfort zones into something more vital. it's not easy to be a good girl, but it is also not a choice. 
i am currently studying early childhood development and would like to work with preschool aged children. other than that i am positive about the fact that i do want to start a family soon. after finding partner of course, not by myself. as a woman i know my purpose is to create a loving and positive environment for my family to prosper. that would make me happy and that is what i consider success.
always being true to myself, and making no apologies for it.
i dunno... a lot of people point out my good posture. go figure.
books: lately a lot of my reading has been for school. i find that most of the reading i do now is not for pleasure, it is more uploading information and filling in the gaps of knowledge to help me navigate through my life a little easier. not to say i do not enjoy it, but it is not the same as when i was a kid. i recently moved and so had a chance to pull out some childhood favorites to re-read. including anything by zilpha keatley snyder, the giver, a wrinkle in time, the changeling, flatland, invisible man, black boy, & moliere's school for wives to name a few.  movies: not a huge movie fan, the last movie i saw in a theater was umm... mama mia? not by choice, i took my mom when i was visiting a few years ago. all i remember from it is that young blonde girl. she is gorgeous, and the entire film all i could do was stare at her lips. i'm not into chicks, but her lips are perfect and if i ever got an opportunity i would of course kiss them. oh, right - movies, so the movies i like are varied and will probably give you no clue into my personality but here goes: labyrinth, a clockwork orange, empire records, clerks, across the universe, apocolypse now, sleepers, malibu's most wanted, chitty chitty bang bang, p.s. i love you, and other random movies i saw on a whim or at a friends and was inspired by.  music: i love all types of music from classic rock to folk, hip-hop & some rap to oldies & funk, modern rock and occasionally drawn to electronica or dance. the beatles, crosby stills nash & young, janis joplin, led zeppelin, alice in chains, inxs, weezer, the offspring, audioslave, 311, stp, velvet revolver, metallica, red hot chili peppers, system of a down, tool, mason jennings, delta spirit, the fleet foxes, arcade fire, poe, george clinton, cammeo, hussulah, mac dre, dre dog, too short & countless other artists found randomly included in the soundtrack of my life for any and every reason imaginable.  food: i am a healthy eater naturally. i really try to avoid franchise or chain restaurants at all costs - simply because i find them horribly impersonal and they give me flashbacks of my many days as a serving robot. i love to find the mom & pops type small restaurants that serve large portions of food i can neither pronounce or recreate at home. these are nearly extinct in silicon valley so i generally choose to cook at home and love the atmosphere it creates. good friends, a bottle of wine, music, laughter and hot food sizzling on the stove is my idea of a perfect friday evening.

how i should not spend so much time in my head thinking. my fears, both rational or irrational and how to overcome them. how to get the world back on track and restore fairness : ) my shortcomings and ways to improve them. how i can be more patient choosing my battles wisely and not letting my principles get in the way of opportunities and ultimately success. how to be less self-righteous and more accepting of others. how to both forget and remember the past, and when each is warranted. how to truly live my life in peace as is detailed in the peace prayer by saint francis assisi. how i should not spend so much time thinking!
usually i am studying, working on any number of projects, cooking dinner or sharing dinner with friends. nothing special but always enjoying myself and whatever company or plans i have.
i suffer from a debilitating disorder that forces me to disclose my thoughts and feelings, even when i should keep them to myself. some find this refreshing, others think it's rude. i wear my heart on my sleeve, so you never need to guess what i am thinking. i am direct and assertive and prefer people who are the same (at least with me). i can't imagine anything 'more' private that a stranger would want to know, but go ahead and ask - odds are i'll answer.

""protection has lived in many kinds of houses. always the walls are decorated with rugs and blankets from around the world. she has studied ancient architecture and the habits of butterflies and spiders. when the caterpillar is dying and the new butterfly is yet to be born, it constructs a chrysalis. we also have this need. however, many of us are too proud or have forgotten how to go inside. protection has learned from the butterflies how to make a chrysalis for the changing human heart.""  ""courage has roots. she sleeps on a futon on the floor and lives close to the ground. courage looks you straight in the eye. she is not impressed with power trippers, and she knows first aid. courage is not afraid to weep, and she is not afraid to pray, even when she is not sure who she is praying to. when courage walks, it is clear that she has made the journey from loneliness to solitude. the people who told me she is stern were not lying; they just forgot to mention that she is also kind.""  ""compassion wears saturn's rings on the fingers of her left hand. she is intimate with the life force. she understands the meaning of sacrifice. she is not afraid to die. there is nothing you cannot tell her. compassion speaks with a slight accent. she was a vulnerable child, miserable in school, cold, shy, alert to the pain in the eyes of her sturdier classmates. the other kids teased her about being too sentimental, and for a long time she believed them. in ninth grade she was befriended by courage. courage lent compassion bright sweaters, explained the slang, showed her how to play volleyball, taught her you can love people and not care what they think about you. in many ways compassion is still the stranger, neither wonderful, nor terrible, herself, utterly, always.

69,"i think i may be one of those twentysomethings you read about in the new york times who took so much longer than their parents did to get their lives together. thankfully, things have progressed magnificently in the last couple years, and i'm proud to say that i again feel cool enough for online dating.  i'm in a master's program for counseling psychology and am entering my second year of clinical training, which means i am actually being entrusted with the emotional well-being of strangers. it is astonishing, profound, peculiar, transformational work that i find deeply gratifying. but don't worry: i've retained my taste for the absurd, and eventually do tire of talking about feelings.  because everything sounds better in list-form, the following are some arbitrarily chosen facts about myself:  (1) i can win staring contests with cats. (2) in my off-hours i read, exercise, converse, study, garden, meditate, do arty things, and plan lots of projects that i only sometimes start and almost never finish. (3) i own three chess sets, but don't play chess. (4) in people, i like a precise mix of church giggles and smoldering contemplation; my friends, failing to achieve the impossible, tend to gravitate dramatically toward one extreme or the other. (5) i am deeply offended by bad art, and i'm not sure why. (6) i am not above eating an entire plate of kale and then going to smoke a cigarette. (7) i can yawn without moving my face. (8) i have a contradictory blend of intense compassion and utter self-absorption. (9) i enjoy silence, but not in elevators. (10) i have been a beginning yoga student for 8 years. (11) i can never seem to stand up straight, but when i do: watch out. my height has been described by some as ""gangly"" and others as ""elven"", which to me are two very different things. i have also been told i resemble a ""bundle of sticks."" (12) my best friend once told me that if i turned out to be a figment of her imagination she wouldn't be surprised, which we agreed was both an enormous compliment and a colossal insult. (13) my pet peeves include people who make noise in movie theaters, a lopsided pasta/sauce ratio, and those who take a really long time in single-occupancy public restrooms even though they know others are waiting because the door handle has jiggled like seven times. also, i think people who feel they're too good to bag their own groceries are disgusting. (14) ""winged migration"" has been in my netflix queue for 4 years. (15) i have 35 plants in my room, a la max from where the wild things are. (16) i am happy with my life, and it'd be swell to share it with someone. (17) i don't talk about myself this much in person.

books - some recently appreciated ones are: is everyone hanging out without me? (and other concerns) by mindy kaling, the hunger games by suzanne collins (only read the first one so far), immortality by milan kundera, and tuff by paul beatty. i also like anything by david sedaris and oscar wilde.  movies - bill & ted's excellent adventure, kuch kuch hota hai, big man japan, and most fluffy rom-com type things, even though their weak sauce female characters and gender politics in general piss me off. other recent things i've seen and enjoyed on netflix: viva cuba, tie me up! tie me down!, and today's special  shows - the office, parks & rec, modern family, how i met your mother, gossip girl, anthony bourdain's no reservations  music - bollywood, pop, hip hop, indian classical  food - god, i fucking love food: pizza, ethiopian, thai, indian, burgers, pasta, fondue, french-vietnamese fusion, or whatever. i understand the socio-political significance of organic and locally sourced food, but i am not a food snob, and i can totally rock chain restaurants too.

77,"i'm pretty sure all the questions below this one summarize me better then i can. here goes nothing. i am a semi-typical 20-something. just finishing up college and wondering what comes next. looking forward to life outside of school with determination but also trepidation. i would love nothing more than to move back to sf, where i stayed for three years when i started college (2005). i like to just walk. i mean that, just walk wherever in no particular direction with no destination in mind and i'll do it until my feet have blisters the size of quarters. i try not to make a habit of anything. i am learning to play guitar. trying to build up the confidence to record my singing. i work at the craft center on campus at ucd, sometimes. i love to craft. i know how to make glass beads and pendants, i can screen print a t-shirt, sculpt with clay, paint, and draw. i have intentions of learning alot of things, including but not limited to: sewing my own clothes, welding and blacksmithing, fire dancing, how to walk on stilts, aerial silks, and ballroom dancing. i like to work on my car. it's a 1995 bmw and is in constant need of tinkering. she's my baby.  i am affectionate, fun-loving, and happy
i'm am graduating from college at ucdavis as an anthropology major. working on becoming an archaeologist! i like to dig in the dirt and find bones. other than that, i spend alot of time on my car, and on my craft projects. this fall i am going to spend more time at my friends circus and learn awesome new things, and may be working at renn faire! which would be exciting, seeing as i spend all possible weekends there anyway if i can. i also like to hang around with my friends, tho alot of them are in sf now and i can't see them that often. life is good. i'm making the most of it!
drawing, painting, creating found art pieces....umm, writing, singing, playing around. i like to make things. i like to do things. i'm interesting in learning how to do almost anything. suggest something, you never know. i might try it.
my hair, since its long and blond and wavy-like. also my eyes which are a nice green. sometimes my sense of style, depending on the day. my smile. i smile alot.
books: abarat, sabriel trilogy, wheel of time. anything by neil gaiman, jane austen, diana wynne jones, robert hienlien, clive barker, and patricia briggs. i like to read. alot. i'm not going to keep listing or this cold go on all day.  movies: pride & prejudice, serenity (firefly), benny & joon, the breakfast club, marie antoinette, paprika, howl's moving castle, spirited away, snatch, the boondock saints, zerophilia, the princess bride... as i think of more i will expand on this.  music: the decemberists, tegan & sara, moby, muse, yeah yeah yeah's, iron & wine, garbage, nine inch nails, nirvana, hole, flogging molly, amanda palmer (dresdendolls, evelynevelyn), pink floyd, the beatles, ok go, placebo, red hot chilipeppers... and more.  food is one of my most favoritest things ever! :) feed me, whatever it is i will try it once. unless it's mushrooms... also i don't usually eat meat, but im not a vege.
my music, my hands (is that two??), sunshine, someone to love, a good book, and a good friend.
music and books. also i think alot about what to do with my life, or how to make things in my life work out right. i think about having kids, though not right now. i think about what it would be like to fly an airplane, i've been in plenty and i've even helped my dad fly, but i've never been in the pilots seat. i have thought about getting a fish, or a chameleon. i think about what it will be like when i finally figure out what this is all about.
at a concert or the movies, or sitting in front of the computer, occasionally i'm in a car driving 100 mph with friends and stealing mcdonald's garbage can lids just to move them into phone booths! :) generally wreaking havoc.
that i spend way too much time on the internet. i take 40 minute showers sometimes. i'm a nerd. it's hard for me to fall out of love. i need people.

livening up a tedious work meeting, dancing with strangers at weddings, making truffle mac n' cheese, coming up with good halloween costume ideas in the off-season, entertaining small children for short periods of time...
i'm always comfortable, even walking into a place where i don't know anyone, or stepping off a plane in a foreign country. i will talk to anyone. in fact, i enjoy starting conversations with strangers. i find that the most interesting folks are never the ones you would have guessed were interesting at all.

82,"i moved to sf ~7 months ago, and so far i'm really liking it, but i'm looking to grow my circle of friends and hitting it off with a cute girl along the way is even better.  my latest interest is rock climbing. i've been going 3x/week to planet granite and having a blast. so perhaps a good way to meet if you als climb is just to be tr belay partners.  i'm originally from the chicago area, which is still where my very small family lives, but for the last 8 years enjoying the beaches, mountains and deserts in san diego.  i'm an adventurer by heart, and always seeking something out of the ordinary, to challenge me, to spark my imagination, or simply surprise me when i'm least expecting it. my ideal girl would do the same.  i've traveled to many places in the world, but there's still a ton left for me to see, and a major goal is to find a girl that shares this travel bug with me. at some point in the next few years, i'd love to quit my job to travel for ~1yr with a girl i love, and then return to the normal us life/career, with both our lives enriched.
isn't this the million dollar question... work in a profession that i enjoy travel the world when i take leave from work keep in shape doing something outside during the weekends relax with a book, hang with friends or something misc the rest of the time

my passport a playful pet comfortable bed good music good book orange juice
where i'm traveling to next, and where do i find a great girl to take with me
i typically don't like ""typical"" nights... i'll browse various show and event calendars for some sort of interesting thing to check out with friends or a date... and occasionally after an exhausting week will just relax and wake up early the next day to go on a hike
i'm actually very open about things that perhaps some would be not willing to quickly admit, but i don't feel that sharing private things to (as of yet) complete strangers is the way to do it.
if you love hiking/camping, traveling in 3rd-world countries, local family-run restaurants, coffee shops, bars with live music and good micro-brewed drafts, outdoor activities (snowboard/ski/kayak/sports/run), etc. then definitely write and say hi!  you live within 30mins assuming traffic, as i'd prefer to get into a relationship where its not a burden to see each other on weekdays.  btw, i own some nice stuff, yet don't consider myself materialistic, and i've learned that girls that always want to be pampered, be seen at the new trendy club, or expects to be taken to 5-star restaurants or hotels, doesn't match my down to earth lifestyle. however, i'll definitely treat you like a princess as well, as long as you don't take it for granted. also, bonus points for curly hair, but i don't discriminate ;)"
83,"i love many things, laughing however is at the top of that list. i'm kind of a goofball, but in a subtle ways for the most part. dry humour, sarcasm. i guess i just find humour/interest in many things that most people don't even notice. i'm quirky...but endearingly so (or so people say). i spend a lot of time looking for new (to me, anyway) music to add to my collection, looking for interesting events/activities/hobbies to try out around the city and revising mental maps of where i'd like to end up eventually. i love hunting for just the right vintage pieces. naturally, i'm an etsy whore, and can be found perusing vintage furniture stores, especially the alameda county antique fairs. my most recent vintage purchase was a gorgeous grundig majestic record console, i do believe it's my favourite piece of furniture i own now.  i like trying out cozy new places to eat, and new recipes, but i'm not by any stretch of the mind a 'foodie'. i frequent wine bars and coffee shops, bay area staples. i _love_ the beach...i totally appreciate being relatively close to the beach, after having lived in ny, where the beach was neither close to the city nor worthwhile. i like finding fun new ways of being active, like finding new trails to jog, paths to bike or walls to climb. going on spontaneous adventures is one of my favourite things to do, and a fun way to get to know people. i love all things creative, so art walks, gallery openings, live performances, museums, activities that involve creating art, are all places that i tend to gravitate towards...and i'm always looking for more people to that are also into these kinds of events.  i'm into technology, particularly mobile, which is the industry i work in. it's a long story as to how i got here, but it's where i want to be and i actually don't hate my job. i tweet and facebook. and read tech blogs like engadget and gigaom to keep up with the current goings on with the latest gadgets. but, i also read magazines like juxtapoz, big up, etc. because i love them and for the way it offsets the techier stuff in my line up.  when it comes to friends, i'm super loyal and i think respect is important. bad communication in any relationship, friendship or otherwise is the kiss of death in my opinion, and a personal pet peeve of mine. i like to be as up front as possible in most situations...even if that's not what the person wants to hear.  eventually, i'd love to settle down with someone who i really enjoy, respect, and feel a strong connection with. ideally, i'd like for that person to be pretty different from me, into their own scene, but still have some interests overlap with mine. i don't really like to rush into dating, but when i find someone i like, i tend to want to spend time, and get to know them. i'm a cuddler. and a hand holder. and a just because-er. and likely, a professional grade spooner. although dating-wise, this past year has been very mismatched for me, as it seems that i haven't been into the people that have been into me, and vice versa. hopefully eventually, a mutual dig will occur...i wouldn't settle for anything less.  things i <3. traveling, learning languages, hand-knit goods, mixed tapes, diptyque candles, architecture, good investments, creativity, ink, intelligent speculation, kindred souls, scorpios, animal rescue and rehabilitation, paths less traveled, documentaries, acoustic guitars, the beach, thunderstorms, cozy coffee shops, positivity, underdogs, survivors, deviation from the norm, any type of gadgetry esp mobile technology, boxee, twitter, etsy!, trader joes, interactive media, innovation, imported cars, ancient civilizations, good teachers  i am optimistic, quirky, and fun-loving
being in the moment as much as possible...taking my time to really internalize this, and all these amazing moments.  iteratively refining my life goals. i've found that life is a process, and i'm definitely still working towards lots of things.
coming up with really good ideas listening tripping over stuff singing anything, anywhere spooning
that they can't figure out what my ethnic background is. everyone thinks im filipina lately!
this is a long list...my musical taste is pretty eclectic, lots of different types of indie from rock to ambient...i really try to stay away from getting stuck in any one genre, but as it stands now, my collection looks a bit like this: dubstep/uk electro-infused. mount kimbie, deadboy, four tet, pariah, vvv, skream, scuba, george fitzgerald, jacques greene, little dragon, cocteau twins, washed out, beach house, warpaint, mumford & sons, tegan & sara, the cure, radiohead, atoms for peace (thom yorke's superband), bon iver, fink, noah and the whale, joanna newsom, beirut, do make say think, explosions in the sky, the radio dept, galaxie 500, yeah yeah yeahs, peter bjorn and john, vampire weekend, ok go, al green, sam cooke, otis redding, new edition, a tribe called quest, gangstarr, pharcyde, de la soul, the roots, miles davis, etc - it probably would've been easier just to list the link to my last.fm account: http://goo.gl/uot0e  ok, vietnamese gets the award for being most frequented in 2010, but also eat japanese, mediterranean, italian, indian, ethiopian, american, korean often. i like well implemented fusion (ie not just slapping 2 generes of food on the same plate and calling it fusion). i'm always down to try something new, in fact i generally prefer it. ;)

this changes on a daily basis. some days it's deep existential topics. others it's how to get my bangs to lay right. today's topic: knitting, i'd really like to learn. i have quite the soft spot for hand-knit items. anyhow, whatever it is that i ponder on, there's usually a fair amount of introspection involved.
i'm typically pretty beat by friday nights, so i tend to do something really chill at home, while i decompress. sometimes i'll grab drinks, dinner or check out a gallery opening with friends. saturdays are typically my going out nights.
when i work out i listen to lady gaga. heh.
you would like to get to know more about me."
86,"welcome to my profile, your search is now over.  i love mountain biking, sketching in nature, urban hikes, camping, climbing, yoga classes, getting really hungry and then eating, cyclocross, bike touring and spending time with friends doing those things (some of those things are not nearly as fun to do alone)
what am i doing with my life? designing software, going to yoga a lot, riding bikes with friends, learning to cook new things, and planning some tropical travel with a bike ...maybe a surfboard.
being corny. perseverance.
i'm laughing at my own joke (or yours).
reading: the onion, mcsweeney's.net cracks me up pretty regularly, unaccustomed earth, hunger games, yoga journal, bike magazine, alan o'bannons guide to backpacking, ...  music: iron and wine, band of horses, mgmt, the sounds, little dragon, the new pornographers, beach house, feist, nouvelle vauge, sean hayes, the rapture, the music they play in yoga classes, bon iver, gayngs, otis redding, chris isaak, dick dale, ..., ..., ...., and i'm a sucker for cover songs (i was at an iron & wine concert, they covered wild horses and i kinda melted.)  movies: the princess bride, run lola run, the departed, best in show, ... room with a view---yep, i'm a chick. i also enjoyed watching jack ass, watched it with my friend and it was hillarious, but then i saw some of it by myself and i hated it (just goes to show that who you're with changes everything).  tv: i don't have a tv or cable, but occasionally i'll get hooked on a tv show via netflix like friday night lights downton abbey the muppets made a big impression on me as a kid, i love those guys in the balcony, i love animal!!!, but my favorite is the swedish chef --> smrg di brg!!! i think i would watch more sports if i had a tv. i would probably watch a lot of pbs and probably rot my brain with reality tv (i'm glad i can't)
i have these luxuries and i really appreciate them:  - my city bike --- it's so liberating to be able to get anywhere in san francisco on my bike in less time than muni could get me there and for free ... and it keeps me fit and energized to ride everywhere i go.  - pencil paper and watercolors --- i can draw anything i set my mind to.  - bike racing --- this has become a corner stone of my social life and i love it.  - the vast expanse of wild places around the bay area to hike and mountain bike (we are so lucky!). the only bad thing about these is if you sit home on a weekend you really have to feel guilty for not going someplace amazing.  - earthworms---we can't live without them.  - i'm also pretty happy about hot springs  and flowers, especially wildflowers  (i'm going to add to this)  my mountain bike hydration love
activities, planning mountain bike rides.  food---i like to eat well, i enjoy cooking healthy food and i appreciate artfully prepared food very much.  travel  work (i get absorbed in work in a good way)  adopting a greyhound ..even though i enjoy not having the responsibility right now.  art and things i want to paint
packing for an adventure, out with friends or having friends over for a feast.
(this space intentionally left blank)
you want to.  ideally: * you're compassionate and empathetic * you enjoy staying fit * you love children (as in, you don't dislike them) * you think funny sarcasm is funny * you're good with money (as in, not bad with it) * if you were my friend, you would set yourself up with me."
91,"i just moved to the north bay after living in la and the oc for 3 years. i went to college in west virginia and grew up on the east coast. i'm probably the only person you'll ever meet from delaware. i miss having a dog.  i am impulsive, resourceful, and overly optimistic
i'm currently working on an animated motion picture for disney.
math... does that count? i'm good at guitar, i'm even better at soccer. i'm also really good at assigning nicknames that tend to stick. i have incredible skill/luck when it comes to bowling and i'm terrible at guitar hero.
i'm rarely serious, unless it's seriously funny...
books: i hope they serve beer in hell, death by black hole movies: dumb and dumber, zoolander, beautiful girls music: weezer(pinkerton era), oldies, copeland to name a few. food: pretty much anything, especially seafood.
dogs bonfires guitars family & friends wool rain
if i was an awesome, beautiful girl, where would i be?
friday is probably the least typical day for me. so far this month: salsa dancing in san francisco building a shelf, from scratch. at the movies in san rafael.
i once had a secret desire to be a magician.

93,"i'm still new to sf, moved here from chicago last august. i was born in the philippines and first moved to the us when i was almost 3.  i've lead a pretty remarkable life, i've earned a lot of awesome opportunities that i've taken advantage of. moving around the country since my family moved to the us helped me learn to seek out opportunities and taught me to be able to put myself out there.  i like to go to the park and just read. i love to travel! i'm an outdoors person; i like bouldering, being in the water (not the frigid ocean though), snowboarding, soccer, hiking, bike riding and just touring the city.
i'm exploring the world, making sure it's still round.  check out some of my stories hansomejake.tumblr.com  i'm currently earning another degree and living life as it comes. i'm exploring the city and am always trying to learn more.  i'm looking for an opportunity to stand up against domestic violence. in the past i've always done the walk a mile in her shoes. now i'm in sf...i'd like to find a new one.
cooking, making my own recipes. (vegetarian mexican pumpkin enchiladas, pasta salad, sweet potato lentil loaf; just to name a few) being awesome at making people laugh traveling. climbing trees or rocks. directions (one of my nicknames: jakeps) i'm a great conversationalist, i know a lot about a lot of things...which also helps out for trivia nights.
the bright blue eyes and the dimples
books! abraham lincoln vampire hunter, david cross i drink for a reason, a thousand splendid suns, hunger games, freakonomics, soccernomics, alchemist, all quiet on the western front, animal farm, playing for pizza and eating animals.  movies...i don't trust anyone who hasn't seen the big lebowski.  shows, not really a tv guy but i'll zonk out from time to time. i love wait wait and this american life. ira glass and carl kassel are two of my heroes. one day carl will be the voice on my answering machine.  music- i'm more of an all around music fan. the smiths, mumford, vampire, selah sue, papa, xx, paperboy, discovery, april smith, kyteman, alamo racetrack, teddybears, george clinton, atmosphere, sublime, bob...so much more!  food!!! eff yeah i love food; indian, italian, mexican, thai, vietnamese, you name it! i keep a mostly vegetarian diet with the occasional mission burrito. i'm a connoisseur of sf burritos.
my passport humor scrumptious food adventures friendship sunshine
possibilities; what adventure awaits me on the horizon...
out on the town either bar hopping, checking out a show or doing something johnnyfuncheap suggested. perhaps attending a couchsurfing event.
there are a large percentage of women that i match up with on here higher than 90%.
you like scavenger hunts you don't list your iphone as something you can't live without. you have a dog!"
94,"my names josh, and i create art for a living. i work as a conceptual artist at a north beach studio. in my spare time i like to play music, adventure around the city, check out music, or just hang out @ home. i prefer meeting people in real life, but i'm not opposed to meeting new friends from the internets..  hit me up if you'd like to know more about me :)
living it
everything
i honestly couldn't say....
-books: anything joseph campbell - osho - terry brooks - ancient greek mythology/philosophy- ""the tao of physics""(currently) - c.bukowski, foucault, and other post modernists - william s. burroughs - the futurist manifesto ( no seriously - i read it every now and then) much more.....  tv: kill your tv  music: - 90's techno - darkwave - metal - bluegrass - punk rock - ambient - rock n roll - dubstep/glitchstep - classic alternative  pretty much everything....  food: things that don't make me vomit ;) or that are not poisonous

96,"you like horses. i am a horses. understanding have i that ladies love horses. always up for some ""horse-ing"" around.  please do not sing '""hey soul sister"" to me. i like hay. i get it.  when you sing ""hey soul sister"" you are pulling a ""train"" on me. i do not want to have a ""train"" pulled on me.  i am not witty.  i may travel. here is a(n) list of just some of the places i've visi(t)ed in the last 5 years.  big sur, death valley, guilin, guyana, hollister, hong kong, horse heaven hills, iceland, king's canyon, las vegas, lassen, macau, mexico city, mono lake, oaxaca, nova scotia, red mountain, sequoia, trinidad, yosemite, your mom's house  am i dead pan. questing mark.  i'm not indecisive i am indincisive.
wine. food. cats. travel. art. living the dream!  i recently moved to sf from a town called millhaven, it was small, mean, and cold.  i'm working on my masters in sommeliering. ms if you will.
going on brannigans.  entertaining myself. falling down. telling jokes. cooking. diplomacy. conversating on a wide variety of subjects. scrabble. wandering. wearing short pants (i don't know why i put this in here, i am not at all good at wearing short pants)  being the man of tomorrow: here; today!  interrupting... i said interrupting... interrupting jokes.  being a robot.
people don't really notice me. i always blend into the background. when they do notice me, they say ""wow, i didn't notice you there!"". so, i guess the first thing people notice about me is that they don't notice me.  wrap your head around that one.
my favorite book of all time is ""frog eats toad's poisonous unborn children, gets sick and dies (but frog's younger cousin thrives!). other than that, i read a lot of non-fiction, most of it alcohol related.  i'm a fan of modernism, in writing and visual arts.  here is a random sampling of some artists that i enjoy.  larionov, biddle, roth, shaw, corman, housman, ibsen, woronov, de palma, tuttle, still, hoeydonck, twombly, thiebaud, bechtle, gordon, norb, cronenberg, carpenter.  i like going out to see live shows (music, plays, opera, etc) but don't get out as much as i'd like.  i really enjoy 70's trash cinema. the apple, phantom of paradise, the warriors. i recently saw the muppets and shame and enjoyed them both (though they were both a touch heavy handed in different ways).  music? here are some bands i've listened to during a week last year or something like that. action bronson, black bananas, the cars, the chap, cloud nothings, future of the left, modeselektor, trust, the 2 bears, destroyer, lone, pelle carlberg, gino soccio, killdozer, cows, merle haggard, azoto, mr. motherfuckin' exquire, man... or astroman?, major lazer, nick cave, jens lekman, descendants, war on drugs, den haan...  did i mention gino soccio? because he's awesome, and you have probably never heard of him.  just kidding.the only artists i ever listen to are taylor swift, that one band that gweneth paltrow's husband is in, and rudimentary peni....  seriously. the best song ever is sex rash  i like all food. cooking and eating it. i go out to eat a lot. i tend to get a lot of free food and drink when i go to restaurants. it's a hazard of the industry i'm in. i'm obsessed with beverages of all kinds. i could spend a lot of time talking about water, or wine, or liquor, or tea, or (fill in the blank)

rumphius pummelos. how did cat hair get on that. nematodes. how i can get my art onto the moon. why i get dirty looks when i ask people if i can taste their counoise.  why people don't think i'm serious.  when it's appropriate to us 'are not' instead of 'aren't'.  how aren't sounds really weird when you say it 10 times in a row.
definitely, probably, working; maybe reading.  loading up celery man, and getting into tain.  sex(t)ing up your mom.
on sutter st, somewhere between market st and union square, my social security number is carved into the sidewalk. i thought it was funny when i did it, and still think it's funny....  so you can totally find out my social security number if you want to.  also,  i don't mind you coming here and wasting all my time.
if you think [fill in later] is awesome.  you are super uncool cool.  you are super cool uncool.  if you take yourself really really really seriously.  people weren't paying attention to the above sentence so i added an extra really.  a soul crushingly boring time a-peals to you.  banana.  that was a joke.  why aren't (are not) you laughing?"
97,"me in a nutshell: i'm an easy going and down to earth kind of guy who appreciates life and all the great things it has to offer. (after all, isn't the purpose of life to make lasting memories??) i work hard and play hard. i have a soft spot for the outdoors (am an avid hiker, camper, ""beach relaxer"") but am always open to trying new things with friends and soon-to-be friends.
working like there's no tomorrow, but having fun like there's no today. i try and live life to the fullest every moment i am aware. (if life is something we experience but just once, why not have a good time?)
listening to others, supporting, having a good time!
friendliness, optimism, and spontaneity
movies: god father i and ii, shawshank redemption, sleepless in seattle, etc..  music: disco pop to hard rock; i like it all!
1. (leave blank) (<- this could be you!) 2. family/friends 3. love 4. laughter 5. memories 6. money
what life must be like in the parts of the world that i haven't touched (yet)!
enjoying good company. dining out or just plain ole' good hangin' out!
sorry, i am a bit shy. (what's with this question?? lol)

you find challenge rewarding."
101,"from san diego to the bay six years ago. gave up the sun, the beach, and the mexican food for the fog, the cold beach, and burritos with rice and beans wrapped in foil (which i am still getting used to.....okay, farolito is pretty damn good). i still have that hakuna matata mentality - i never sweat the small stuff......brah.  i'm not a very serious person (unless i need to be). i joke and laugh a lot, and people think i'm always happy-go-lucky. in reality, i'm extremely depressed, on six types of mental medication, and i have a service animal for companionship. just kidding. see, i told you.  i would like to think of myself as an extremely patient and calm person. i find a sense of accomplishment in being able to balance those who aren't.  i don't believe in the art of profile-making, and i think meeting someone in person is the only way to go. we're not all salespeople, and i'm glad.
going with the flow. always trying to find the next best thing.
imitating accents. not using the word ""like"", after like every like word. making peoplemyself laugh.
is that they didn't notice me. i'm a ninja.
sadly, to be perfectly honest, i don't remember the last time i read a book cover to cover. if someone can get me started, that would be an amazing accomplishment for both them and me. i have never been told, ""wow, you don't read. do you?"", so i guess that doesn't make me too different......right?  i love will ferrell movies. my ultimate favorite is step brothers. you're probably waiting for me to insert a step brothers quote here, but i am not one who is known to easily quote lines off the top of my head, and i deeply admire those who can. it's probably because i don't read books. i am a true sucker for chick flicks. i usually only watch movies once, then forget about them. like, remember this scene when....nope. movies of epic proportion deserve my attention multiple times, and step brothers is epic.  on the tube: summer heights high, angry boys, dexter, homeland, workaholics  music: anything, really. a lot of miike snow, bombay bicycle club, the whitest boy alive, empire of the sun, and 106.1 kmel stuff are in my ears these days.  i love food. any kind. i am probably the least picky person when it comes to food. although, if you're holding a gun to my head, i would list my favorites in this order: mexican food.
5 cliche things, and my road bicycle.
what does life have in store for me?
going to bed early, for work on saturday, which is my friday. if it said ""on a typical saturday night i am"", i would respond, ""going to bed early."" i don't go out too much, but if i do, it's to eat out, maybe have a few drinks, or karaoke bar hop. i used to love going out to the clubs and lounges - and don't get me wrong, i can still cut up a rug on the dancefloor, if dancefloors had rugs, and the occasion arose - but, at this point, i would be more interested in being in bed, watching a movie, or just looking at the inside of my eyelids.
i snore. like a velociraptor. but only on my back! i think.

102,"i'm on a temporary hiatus from trying to define myself, particularly in concise blurbs. however, i'm finding this reluctance to summarize just might be adversely affecting my socio-economic success levels.  if you found the blurb above to be a) wordy, b) confusing, or c) wholly devoid of humor and irony, then you'll most likely find me annoying.
for a living? teaching cpr, first aid, and assorted safety courses. not a bad gig to have while plotting my creatively-fueled world-takeover.  on a deeper level? shifting paradigms, actively-not-writing, resolving conflict(s), and falling without getting hurt.  physically? staying fit... actually, forget 'fit'. i'm going for optimal health, with all the fun stuff too (like doing a yoga class, then going for a chili dog and beer). i will never be not-fit again. ever.  other things? looking out for my crazy family, building vintage german cars, practicing aikido, being the change, fearing change, facing the change, creating change, sparing change.
being unequivocal... sometimes.  public speaking.  doing some crazy-ass martial-arts shit to a fool! (if said fool were to attack me in a very specific way, at half speed).  going down on you.
that my green eyes are red.
when it comes to fiction, i like to read what i (currently don't) write; culturally-subversive sci-fi and conflicted-hero thrillers... any early orson scott card novels (ender's game, speaker, worthing saga) are awesome, as well as anything by lee child or michael connelly or stephen hunter. for non-fiction, the titles that are jumping into my memory are ""don't think of an elephant"" and pretty much anything by malcolm gladwell (i included him so you'll know i'm smart and well-read)  movies? the first bourne, the first matrix, and the first two star wars. shawshank, amelie, three kings, boogie nights, and the fresh re-boots of bond and batman. not a whole hell of a lot recently. and by recently, i mean the last 10 years. super 8 was pretty cute. melancholia!! not the most fun movie experience, but that movie still has me pondering weighty issues like astronomy, human psychology, and kirsten dunst's --ahem-- nevermind, just see it.  music... lots. but metal and country make me want to die.
someday, i'll be a monk on a hill and all i'll need is ommmm. but not yet.... here's what i'd currently feel most deprived without:  language. aikido. hot water. chiropractic care. women with fantastic posture and exceptional glandular health. outstanding cannabis.
human behavior. my goals. why i'm not further along with my goals. why i beat myself up for not being further along with my goals. why humans are so hard on themselves and others.  rinse, repeat.  oh, and women with fantastic posture and exceptional glandular health.
falling on my ass a hundred times (that means training aikido), then salving my bruises with an ancient japanese remedy (that means sapporo with the sushi, large please).  or..... basking in the blinding glow of my own white-hot potential (that means smoking weed and surfing the webbernets)  or..... chatting with some random folks i just met. (that actually just means exactly what it means).
how about some dealbreakers right up front...  i'm 41, and back livin with the parents. awesomesauce!! (actually, it's a pretty sweet little cottage on a creek behind their adorable house, and they're an eccentric little hippy couple that vaguely resembles the witch/warlock couple from princess bride.... ""have fun stormin the castle!!"". so it's nice, but yeah--i'm there because i currently lack, ahem, ""earning potential"".  also, for those who haven't been reading carefully, i smoke cannabis. weed, ganja, medicinal marrryjooowanna. i smoke it daily, i have friends who grow it, and i'm a social & political advocate of it. so, any woman desiring extended contact with me (like anything past a quickie) would probably want to be okay with the 4&20.  oh, and.... i'm actually 5' 8 and 3/4"", not 5' 9"", but okcupid doesn't split hairs.
you like my words. you like my face. you'd like to see and hear more.  you'd like to meet for a chat to see if we like each other's voices, attitudes, physiques, pheromones, and philosophies...  you don't mind dating (or sleeping with, or simply making out with) a guy who is doing all of the above with other women.  did i mention the posture and glandular health? (ba-dump bump!)"
104,"i am an energetic extrovert, cheerful and happy almost all of the time, with a good dose of east coast snarkyness thrown in. i have a lot of genuine enthusiasm about a lot of things. i pack a big punch for such a little person.  i thrive on meeting new people and experiencing new things, but also at times seek comfort in the familiar to recharge. i'm an open person- counter to my wasp-y pedigree, i am good at communicating (when i want to be) and and it is important to me to cultivate openness in relationships as well.  i am equally at home in the city as i am in the woods, and need a healthy balance of both to survive. city conveniences that i most rely on include good coffee, microbrews, ethnic food and, you know, culture. but i also need to step outside and leave my iphone behind for extended periods of time to remember what truly matters.  i'm from the northeast (maine) and frequently contemplate returning to that corner of the world to live at some point. i totally love it here (who doesn't?!), but there's just a certain pull to the pine forests and rolling green mountains and granite coastline of my home state that i don't think i'll able to ignore forever.  i am a summer camp kid. i love to climb. i drive a station wagon for adventures, and ride my bike the rest of the time. i can ski like a banshee. i want to someday grow some of my own food-- specifically, concord grapes.
climbing, spending time with friends, cooking, slogging through my impossibly large backlog of new yorkers, trying to find a drink that tops mt. gay and tonic on a summer day, not going to burning man.  for work, i am a reformed architect, now a product manager at an online marketing company. it's not where i will end up, but i am learning a ton... and didn't someone used to tell us as kids that learing was half the battle? i was an impressionable kid.
parallel parking on hills. skiing. making friends, making soup, making endearingly contradictory statements. eating the shit out of asian food.
obviously my hair.
to read, all things chabon, marquez, rushdie, franzen, patchett. the new yorker.  love npr so much that if i could, i would marry it. except the whole ""with a perspective"" series. barf.  love arrested development, twin peaks, friday night lights, homeland, parks and rec. also love downton abbey, though i don't suspect that will help me win the hearts of many single straight men. love the cohen bros, wes anderson and the occasional fascinating documentary.  i like good music- you know, the stuff cool kids like. i'm a snob in that if (insert lame band here) is your favorite, i will be turned off. but i'm also not reading pitchfork and seeking out the next big indie sensation every week. most recent concerts: bon iver, tuneyards/st. vincent.
self deprecating humor the great outdoors chinese food (like, good chinese food) skis + powder airplanes

somewhere doing something fun.  unless i'm getting up super early for skiing/backpacking/climbing/hiking/some sort of day drinking shenanigans. then i'm happily asleep by 10.

106,"i'm a glass-half-full kind of girl, am emotionally wired to be very logical, and abhor drama. i'm eternally curious and work in left-brain things, but enjoy right-brain activities much more .... drawing or creating things. i over-analyze everything, so almost never regret my actions. i always have a point of view, but only share with those who can agree to disagree. i love food... its preparation, presentation, taste, culture, history. i love wind, snow, and water whipping across my face. i watch cnn and read the ny times more than the local news. i love thought-provoking forms of art and expression.  i prefer to be direct, the east coast influence i suppose. you can ask me anything and i will give you a direct answer. i don't play games, except the occasional board or video type. but due to lots of corporate feedback, early adulthood on capitol hill, and friends worldwide, i've learned to be much more circumspect about how my words/actions will be perceived. although when my team is being attacked repeatedly, all bets are off :-p. controlling my temper and extreme diplomacy are learned skills, so i remain constantly vigilant.  i am a mix of cultures, having been born into one, raised in another, and sought others in adulthood. i'm the older of 2 and have 3 nieces, whom i adore. i work to live well. i exercise, so that i can indulge. i need quiet time to recharge, but have a large circle of friends/relatives worldwide with whom i've kept in touch for decades. i try to live like the song, ""i hope you dance"" and the poem instantes by borges.
i need to continually learn or else i get bored. i try to visit a new place every year. i like to try new experiences. skydiving is next. i tend to order those things i have never eaten/drunk before. i try to keep all my relationships in good order, so that i have nothing to confess or say to someone on my death bed that i wouldn't say now. i have been paring down my friendships to spend time with those who really matter to me. i am wondering when i am going to get off my bum and build this sculpture i have designed.

114,"a business owner, a backend/frontend developer, a frequent hiker, a podcast listener, trying to be a banjo player, former bass player, former inorganic chemist, former theoretical magnetic resonator.  i just realized that staring at lava from 20 feet away and having it toss bits of molten rock at me, is probably the single greatest thing in the world.  you're gonna hear ""ma'am"" and ""lady"" from me, i just can't help it, as i've been raised southern style (not southern cali). my accent only comes out when provoked, in similar company, or beverage induced.  an aikidoist and hip - hop - banjo lover (i'm waiting for that genre to be created).  a former chemist turned business owner and frequent traveler (it gets boring sitting in one spot for too long, but i really do like to just go to a new spot and sit).  drive too fast and expect people to be better drivers then they are, and i shall let it be known.  not really into ""open/sf-ness"" crap-ol-la (you may ask yourself ""then why are you in sf?"". my answer is, i'm not. i'm in oakland). not my bag, tried it, didn't like it. don't even like dealing with more then one conversation at the same time (that could just be a time thing too). intj's unite. that's right you heard me.  not that this matters or anything, but according to the two signs (aries and the dragon) and my psych profile (intj), i should be an introverted, good-with-money, loyal, slightly competitive, over generalizing asshole with an uncanny ability to focus. mostly true.  basically i'm lookin' for a partner in crime. while i really like games, i tend to lose them a lot, so i'd prefer not to play them anymore.  me, me, me, me some more, i'd like a side of me with that, can i get me to go? sheesh. but i have questions for you. this is mad question-er website right? - gummy worms or gummy bears? - m&m: red, blue, green? (if you say yellow, orange or brown, you are disqualified) - bla fleck or tony trischka? - brooklyn or la - trees, snow or sand?
recovering from one hell of a month in africa. aikido. trying to learn the banjo. figuring out when and how to take an f1 racing course w/o going bankrupt. i'll figure out what's next when i get back.
- breaking things, then trying to fix them all the while pretending to know what i'm talking about or doing. trouble is i don't really mean to break things sometimes, that can be too expensive sometimes.
i have on shoes.
- if you like ""who's afraid of virginia wolf"", nice. - if you all sorts of music genres appeal to your inner child, nice. - if you know of frank herbert, nice. - if you laugh your ass off at top gear, family guy and/or futurama, i've got a nice tv for that. - if you're gonna be sad when breaking bad and mad men go off the air, i'll be there too. - if you wished treme was as good as the wire, i'd have to agree. - the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. we are all very small. - if beer and pork are involved i'll be way ok. - if japanese food is involved i'll be more then ok. - but really who cares? so long as you got interests of some kind, would be awful if we had all the same ones. how else does one find out about new things?
after spending 3 months with no couch ... i know now, my couch. music, beer, the sun (outdoors), aikido, intertubes
how to play the banjo better. how to blend better with the world. how to get out of the country more often. where's the next trail i've yet to hike?
i have a knack for watching an entire tv series in one sitting, which i do sometimes. mostly these days, it's aikido, a bit of beer and sushi, a bit of vegetating (the week can be a long one sometimes), eaten' cookies and chillin'.
tyler, the creator makes me wanna move.
can type a bit of english. and would like to meet in person (it's way more efficient). and likes alcohol. and doesn't mind that i'm a little shy and it can take some warming up to. and likes to eat cookies and popcorn. and think that bourbon and chocolate is one of the most amazing pairings ever. and doesn't mind that a beard may float in or out from time to time. and thinks that valentines day is a kobayashi maru holiday. and can use google to figure out what that means. and like to start sentences with and.  and think that valentines day is a kobayashi maru holiday. and can use google to figure out what that means.  you'll need to write me too. i know the modus operandi around here is guy contact girl, but i check back here only when provoked, so provoke me."
117,"i'm almost 54 and 1/2 and i've decided what i want to be when i grow up.
working towards my goals.
breaking things, fixing things, building things, making things work. that includes hard things, soft things, intangible and tangible things.
they probably think i'm pissed off but i'm not.
mishima yukio, haiku  lawrence of arabia, tampopo, the professional  latin especially brasilian. weezer! i love their poetry and their jams. strokes, i have dylan, hot tuna, miles davis, doc watson, beethoven, roberta sa, joaquin sabina, johnny cash, among other stations in pandora.  art! period
ummm..... fresh air and water paper towels, bounty, half sheet blue painter's tape a bowl of hot noodles once in a while to restore my faith in humanity
fuzzy things, i hate logic, screw spock
eating brown rice wrapped in shoyu nori with my hands
